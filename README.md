# My new blog

[Laurent Kemp√© - One of the Tech Head Brothers](https://laurentkempe.com/) leveraging now [Statiq](http://statiq.dev/).

I ported it to [Statiq](http://statiq.dev/) from my [previous blog](https://github.com/laurentkempe/blog) which used [Hexo](https://hexo.io/).

I also ported a part of the fantastic theme [Tranquilpeak](https://github.com/LouisBarranqueiro/hexo-theme-tranquilpeak/) from [Louis Barranqueiro](https://github.com/LouisBarranqueiro).
