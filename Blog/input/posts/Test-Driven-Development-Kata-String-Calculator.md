The subject of this article is the [String Calculator](http://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1/) proposed by Roy Osherove. The Kata is done in C# uses Visual Studio 2012, [JetBrains Resharper 7](www.jetbrains.com/resharper/) and [NCrunch](http://ncrunch.net).

But what is a TDD Kata? It is an implementation exercise starting with unit tests and leveraging refactoring that you practice daily for around 15 to 30 minutes.
