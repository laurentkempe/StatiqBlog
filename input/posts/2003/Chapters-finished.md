I finally managed to finish the last chapter I had to write concerning a book about [Sharepoint](http://www.microsoft.com/sharepoint) 2.0 I am writing with some other Microsoft MVPs. I am presenting the way to develop Web Parts with Visual Studio .NET 2003 and the .NET framework. That was an interesting experience. Now we need to see who will edit it.
