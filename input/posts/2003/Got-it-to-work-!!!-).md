Now I got a real place where I can post! Christophe contact me if you wanna know where it is ;-)

So today I attended an interesting presentation "WEB290: Web service discovery: Are we meant for each other?". Thats was not really anything new for me cause I am in charge of evaluating and implementing UDDI solution for the company I work for. But a really good presentation. It will really simplify the life of our infrastructure team.
<!-- more -->

I will also attend the "WEB312: Integrating Applications with UDDI Services" later on.
