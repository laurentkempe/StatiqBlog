I worked a lot, tests and develoment, today to be able to have my site running with .NET Framework 1.1. Basically it is working now but I am still having some issue with DTS to update my PROD database with the data from my TEST Database. Sometimes it fails copying datas from 6 tables sometimes from 5. Really strange. I can't get it. If someone as a step by step dumb way to transfert data from two SQL Servers 2000, I would appreciate.  

I also updated the way we work with my brother on VSS. Now we use [Draco.NET ](http://draconet.sourceforge.net/)to be informed of the update of the other and to be sure to constently integrate without any issue. This tools rocks, whenever you can configure it.
