After some work I ported my portal to version 1.1 of the .NET Framework. The 
only change related to the update of the frameework was due to XSLT and the 
usage of a deprecated method. Cool.
<!-- more -->

I also added some new functionnalities like RSS feed for Articles, How Tos 
and News. Thanks to the [RSS library from AdamKinney](http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/UserSamples/Details.aspx?SampleGuid=82651160-90f3-48af-9f99-1e534472f6e8). There are also new features from 
the administration side like the possibilities to post news from an InfoPath 
form.

Now it is time for testing before going live with it.
