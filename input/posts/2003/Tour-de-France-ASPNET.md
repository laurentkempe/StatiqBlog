Today we are, Mathieu and Laurent, at the "Tour de France". Jerome will arrive for the afternoon. So we only miss Kader to have the whole team at this event. It is not about cycling but about ASP.NET. We will present our web site [Tech head Brothers](http://www.techheadbrothers.com/) to the east of France .NET community. I will post this evening a set of pictures form the event.
