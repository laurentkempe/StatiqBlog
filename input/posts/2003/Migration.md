Last weekend was reserved for the migration of the servers at work from Windows NT4 to Windows 2003. The good point is that after working from the Friday evening to the Saturday morning, the servers were up and running again. The applications owners were testing their applications on Saturday and sent back an OK. Then I monitored the applications all the day, and there were no issues. That a first migration.

The second has nothing to do with my work; it is about my web site: [Tech Head Brothers](http://www.techheadbrothers.com/). My friend Ed Daniel offered me to host the site. HEY!!!! Ed I will never be thankfully enough for that. So I have to deploy the entire site to this new server.
