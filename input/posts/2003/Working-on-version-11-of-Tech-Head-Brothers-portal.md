I am currently working on a new version of my site: [Tech Head Brothers](http://www.techheadbrothers.com "Tech Head Brothers"). This new version will use the .NET 
Framework 1.1. I am facing some difficulties because I had hardcoded some stuff 
in the code before. I know thats BAD, really BAD. But sometimes when you don't 
have that much time you do ugly things.
<!-- more -->

I also installed all the environment that will let my brother work with me. 
Windows 2003 Server with VPN, VSS... We gave a try on GotDotNet workspace but 
that was not as good as we thought in our case, so we will retry 
later.
