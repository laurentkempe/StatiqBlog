I tried Microsoft assessment *"Introduction to Microsoft.NET for Developers"*
<!-- more -->

And here are my results 

# Score Report

**Score**: 63%
**Elapsed Time**: 25 minutes

Overall Score (All Objectives): 63% (19/30)

**You scored better than 94% of those that took this assessment**

Not so bad, but not that good too...
