OK I fixed my main issue. I wasn't able to have my plugin loaded by Jetbrains Omea, and it seems that it is linked with the .NET Framework 2.0 that I use in my plugin, even if Omea Reader is running using .NET Framework 2.0 somehow it can't verify the plugin.

I had to install MSBee so I don't need to install VS 03 again. And now back to the old days of command line I have to compile using such a command:
<!-- more -->

msbuild BlogThisUsingWriterPlugin.csproj /t:Rebuild /p:TargetFX1_1=true

After modifying my csproj MSBuild file to use MSBee

So this is how it look likes in Omea Reader

And the result in Windows Live Writer:

Not bad.

That will be my second plugin for Live Writer and it will be also on Codeplex in [Windows Live Writer Plugins](http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=WLWPlugins) project.

Thanks to [Christopher Frazier](http://www.chrisfrazier.net/blog/default.aspx)Â for the kind help compiling my project on VS 03.

Ok it is 2:01 AM, time to go to bed.
