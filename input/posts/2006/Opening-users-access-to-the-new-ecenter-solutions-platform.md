Tuesday 6th, June 2006 we launched our new platform to the 12 000 users. This 
was a big day for us after lots of efforts we finally made it.
<!-- more -->

After 15 minutes of pure stress because of an issue on a front end server, we 
finally had a platform running without any major issue. The platform is 
running since two days now and we received wonderful feedback about the 
response time. 

The last days and first minutes really showed us the importance of having two 
production streets in fail over mode. And this part was fully tested ;-)

Now we enter a stabilization phase, and for the moment only two adaptations 
on the front end. Not bad with such a complex project.

As next step we planned horizontal scalability of the architecture and 
it will really allow us to grow without any issue with this new architecture. 
But that's another story.
