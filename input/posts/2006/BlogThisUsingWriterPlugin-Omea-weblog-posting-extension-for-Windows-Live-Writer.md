I started to code a plugin that will implement the famous [IBlogExtension](http://www.pocketsoap.com/weblog/stories/2003/04/0023.html) for [Omea Reader and Pro](http://www.jetbrains.com/omea/)Â to target Windows Live Writer.

It will let you select one feed in Omea, right click on it and choose BlogThis, and it will fire up Windows Live Writer with the content of the original post.
