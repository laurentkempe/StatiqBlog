This morning I was able to integrate [Atlas](http://atlas.asp.net/) in the new release under development of [Tech Head Brothers](http://www.techheadbrothers.com/). In less than a hour I had an UpdatePanel in the page that describes the [differents authors](http://www.techheadbrothers.com/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabindex=7&tabid=19) of the site. Now when you click on the picture of an author the biography is shown without the full post back. And it is really really easy. I am also adding a tab to show all publication of the auhtor.

*Congratulations to the Atlas Team!!! Great work.*
