I would like to congratulate all the French "has-been too old" football players :-)

Then I would like to quote [Didier](http://www.didierbeck.com/)
"And my dear Spanish colleagues, friends and non-friends, journalists, trainer and players, sometimes, as in the business field, it is *definitely* better to keep a low profile and to respect your opponents, and more especially before playing a match, even if you have won your last 26 games. Some examples...."

<strong>What about the shameful behaviour of the Spanish fans during the anthem?</strong>

Striker Thierry Henry described the rival supporters' behaviour as shameful. "I've never seen that before in the World Cup. It's shameful that their supporters reacted like that during the Marseillaise. 

<strong>What about the reaction of the trainer after the match? </strong>

"I don't think the final scoreline was an accurate reflection of what happened," insisted coach Luis Aragones after Spain's first defeat in 26 games. 

<strong>What about the racist remarks of the Spanish trainer (for a while) and supporters? </strong>

Aragones and Henry are not the best of friends after Aragonesâ€™ used a racist remark in referring to the France striker while trying to motivate Jose Antonio Reyes, an Arsenal teammate of Henry. <br>Domenech also suggested that some Spain supporters had made monkey noises when the bus carrying the France players arrived at the stadium."

I think that the best answer was given by the French team during the game. THANKS GUYS !!!

<strong>Allez les Bleus! </strong>
