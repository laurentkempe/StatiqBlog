I just made my first checkins on [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com/) for the project [Tech Head Brothers Authoring](http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=THBAuthoring).

CodePlex isÂ REALLY COOL, having an access to a Team Server from Visual Studio 2005 is just great. I like it very much.
<!-- more -->

This is an initial version of my authoring tool and there is more to come that I have not already migrated to this new project. Stay tuned.
