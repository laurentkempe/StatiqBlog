I downloaded for the first time the new version of Internet Explorer and I find quite cool.

You might [download it on this page](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.mspx).

And then you need the must have plugin, [Mouse Gestures for Internet Explorer](http://www.ysgyfarnog.co.uk/utilities/mousegestures/)
