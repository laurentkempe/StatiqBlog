![Tech Ed 2006 Barcelona](/images/2006/french_290x149_dev6.jpg)

Like last year I will attend **Tech Ed Europe**. This time in Barcelona, a wonderful city. I prefer it over Amsterdam. I will arrive on November 6th, mid of afternoon.

It will be the chance to meet some of you and especially **Frédéric Colin**, **Grégory Renard**, **Aurelien Verla** authors on **Tech Head Brothers**.

Who else is coming?
