My migration weekend started on Friday at 5:00PM, you might read more about here : "[First step of a long migration weekend reached](/lkempe/archive/2006/06/03/First-step-of-a-long-migration-weekend-reached.aspx)".

The second step was <strong>System Acceptance Tests</strong> from business application's owners. And I am really happy to say that it went well, even better than what I thought, and all applications are tested and are working well and really fast according to the different testers. So we received the <strong>GO</strong> from the business to activate the new platform to all the users.
<!-- more -->

Tomorrow will be step three with the access of 12 000 users to the platform. I hope it will go like step one and two.
