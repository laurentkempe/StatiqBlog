**Incredible** what you might do with javascript, I cannot believe it. You made an awesome work [Aurel](http://blogs.developpeur.org/aurelien/default.aspx).

You might see this [gadget](http://microsoftgadgets.com/Gallery/) [here](http://microsoftgadgets.com/forums/4865/ShowPost.aspx).

First of all, I want to say that this gadget is not a Flash or Java applet one. It has been thoroughly coded with Javascript using various tips and tricks as Fade In/Out, Clip In/Out, Sprites animation and so on.  

Option pannel will enable you to set the difficulty of the computer and also see the playable squares. The computer is an artificial intelligence hosted on my server.

Moreover, this gadget is localized on your Live.com settings. At present, only french and english versions are available, for other ones, english is set by default. I'm looking for sympathetic translators for the remaining ones.  

Enjoy !
