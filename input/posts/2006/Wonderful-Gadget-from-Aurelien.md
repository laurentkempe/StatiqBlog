First of all, I want to say that this gadget is not a Flash or Java 
      applet one. It has been thoroughly coded with Javascript using various 
      tips and tricks as Fade In/Out, Clip In/Out, Sprites animation and so 
      on.  

Option pannel will enable you to set the difficulty of the 
      computer and also see the playable squares. The computer is an artificial 
      intelligence hosted on my server.  

Moreover, this gadget is 
      localized on your Live.com settings. At present, only french and english 
      versions are available, for other ones, english is set by default. I'm 
      looking for sympathetic translators for the remaining ones.  

Enjoy 
      !
