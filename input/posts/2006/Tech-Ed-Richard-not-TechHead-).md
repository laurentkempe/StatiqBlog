When I  was awarded the first time as MVP, one of the first MVP I met was [Richard Clark](http://blogs.developpeur.org/richardc/default.aspx), a cool guy. And I am happy to see some confusion in one of his last post ;)

"**[J'ai participé à pas mal d'events de Microsoft, et à part les PDC et TechHead, je pense qu'Imagine Cup est bien l'un des évènements les plus gros de MS](http://blogs.developpeur.org/richardc/archive/2006/08/15/23072.aspx)."
<!-- more -->

"I participated to quite some Microsoft events, and apart from PDC and **TechHead**, I think Imagine Cup is one of the biggest event of MS"

He is one judge of the Imagine Cup and created the Project Hoshimi, as far as I know. The idea was in his head at the first MVP Summit we had together in 2002 or 2003, I can't remember.

**Tech Ed **is the Microsoft event all of us knows and **Tech Head**, that became later on [Tech Head Brothers](http://www.techheadbrothers.com/) is my french portal about .NET technologies.

Thanks a lot the advertisement Richard ;)

**Update: **[The whole story about the idea of Project Hoshimi](http://blogs.developpeur.org/richardc/archive/2006/08/15/23074.aspx) is in the last post of Richard (in french) and again he is using TechHead ;)
