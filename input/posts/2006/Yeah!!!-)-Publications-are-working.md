Today is a big day with a **really cool** milestone for 
**[Tech Head 
Brothers](http://www.techheadbrothers.com/)** website.

First I am able to publish/update content on the site with my new publishing 
tool; a word template using vsto 2005 and secured web services. This piece of 
code let me publish content with pictures, colorized source code, zip files for 
sample applictions and this directly out of Word 2003. Really cool!!!
<!-- more -->

Second I can also publish/update/delete news directly from my prefered blog 
tool: [PostXING](http://projectdistributor.net/Releases/Release.aspx?releaseId=325). 
By the way the 2.0 Beta 1.0 was realized and I have to say: "[Chris](http://www.chrisfrazier.net/blog/) you made an awesome work, 
congrats".
