That's it!!! I decided to open the code of the second release of my authoring/publishing tool used on [Tech Head Brothers](http://www.techheadbrothers.com) portal.

The project is hosted on [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com), an online software development environment for open and shared source developers to create, host and manage projects throughout the project lifecycle. It has been written from the ground up in C# using .NET 2.0 technology with Team Foundation Server on the back end. CodePlex is open to the public free of charge.

It is a work in progress and I will need some time to cleanup the solution before making the first checkin of the source code, but it will come.

The project is called [Tech Head Brothers Authoring and it is hosted on this page](http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=THBAuthoring).
