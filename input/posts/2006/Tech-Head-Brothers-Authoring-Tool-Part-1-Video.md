I have quickly posted a [video showing the insertion of an image and source code](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqLqv_sSOgo) using the [Tech Head Brothers Authoring tool](http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=THBAuthoring) on [YouTube](http://youtube.com).

This demo demonstrates offline preview and the ease of inserting images and source code in authored articles.

I used the [fantastic Camtasia](http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.asp) from [TechSmith](http://www.techsmith.com/) to realize the video and was able to upload on YouTube in minutes, really cool tool and service.

<u>Remark</u>: It is a shame that we can't add <object> tag on this blog.
