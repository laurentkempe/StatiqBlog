Tonight the French soccer team played against China in a training match for the World Cup 2006 in Germany.

After 11 minutes, [Djibril Cissé](http://www.djib-cisse.com), was hurt and it seems that his right leg is broken.

I just want to say that I really like this player, and that I am pissed off by this stuff.

<strong>So Djibril good luck for your recover.</strong>
