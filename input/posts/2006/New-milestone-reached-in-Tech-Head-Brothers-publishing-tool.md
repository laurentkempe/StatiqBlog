As said in a past post: [Yeah!!! :-) 
Publications are working](http://weblogs.asp.net/lkempe/archive/2006/03/18/440548.aspx), I am working on the new publishing tool for my 
website [Tech Head Brothers](http://www.techheadbrothers.com/), and 
today I reached another milestone: The tool is now installed on [Laurent 
Duveau](http://www.techheadbrothers.com/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabindex=7&tabid=19&id=18) notebook and he is able to post directly from Word 2003.
<!-- more -->

Currently the tool let the author 

*   choose images to insert using a Document Action Pane

*   copy source code from Visual Studio and paste it into Word 2003, 
  generating an external source code colorized XHTML file

*   have a local disconnected preview of there content through a XSLT 
  rendering 
  post there content on the website using Web Services


And finally here is a picture of what you can get (the design is not finished 
and still a bit buggy) with the tool when the content is published:
