Microsoft just released a beta version of a new tool called [Windows Live Writer Beta 1](http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/).

You might download it on this page: [Microsoft Windows Live Writer](http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/9/a/f9a19f2d-cec4-4a25-9b0b-eb9655ea7561/Writer.msi)

It took me a minute to install it and to configure it for my [blog](/lkempe) on [weblogs.asp.net](http://weblogs.asp.net), you just need to know that the provider is Community Server and the url of the services is: [http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/metablog.ashx](/blogs/metablog.ashx). Then you can go. I used it for that post. And it is really a great tool.

It seems that you can write plugins, but [the link](http://dev.live.com/writer) in the preferences dialog is going nowhere at the moment. But there is [Windows Live Writer SDK](http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/9/a/f9a19f2d-cec4-4a25-9b0b-eb9655ea7561/Windows%20Live%20Writer%20SDK%20(Beta).msi). :-)

I will try it for some time bug my first impression is that it is **REALLY GOOD!!!**

You really have to try the web preview.

**Update:** I found two plugins from [Tim Heuer](http://timheuer.com/blog/) on Codeplex, [Tag4Writer](http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=tag4writer) and [Flickr4Writer](http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=flickr4writer).
