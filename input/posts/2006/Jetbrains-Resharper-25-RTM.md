As you certainly know I you sometimes read my blog I am absolutely addicted to that tool and can't work without it anymore in Visual Studio 2005.

So I am happy to announce that Jetbrains finally released [ReSharper 2.5.](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/) This version is for Visual Studio 2005 only. So what's new on this new version?
<!-- more -->

Main focus was on the improvement of performance; faster installation and startup, faster typing (including auto-popup on Code Completions), plus speedups for code formatting, error highlighting, Live Templates, parameter info, and more.

For sure they also added some new stuff like Navigate from here, Enable/Disable Context Actions, Go To File Member, an improved find results view, Analyze Null References.

But wait!!! You are using VB? hey [Wygwam guys](http://www.wygwam.com/) ;) They now support VB

ReSharper now recognizes VB code in your project and extends the following features to it:
 <li>All navigation and search features  <li>Matching brace highlighting  <li>Ctrl + W (Expand selection)  <li>Ctrl + Q (Quick Documentation Lookup)  <li>Parameter info (no autopopup, works only by Ctrl + P)  <li>Identifier highlighting  <li>Also, when you apply refactorings to C# code, ReSharper warns you if VB usages need to be updated</li> 

I guess the refactoring will also come soon.

And the best for the end the upgrade is free for all users of Resharper.

Don't wait, [download it here,](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/download/index.html) and try it.
