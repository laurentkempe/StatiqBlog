At last TechEd in Amsterdam I was convinced by [Aurel](http://www.techheadbrothers.com/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabindex=7&tabid=19&id=15) to switch the whole design of my community website [Tech Head Brothers](http://www.techheadbrothers.com) from tables formating to CSS. [Aurelien](http://blogs.developpeur.org/aurelien/) shown me crazy stuff they are building in [Wygwam](http://www.wygwam.com/) using CSS and in 5 minutes I was convinced for that change. Now Aurel is kind of my mentor on that and also decided me to go the Atlas way. As I had decided to rewrite the site in ASP.NET 2, I also decided to switch to CSS.

My first experience with CSS was that it is really difficult to get it running on all browsers, but at the time of table I remember that I also had issues. The second problem I had was that lots of the ASP.NET controls are rendering with tables and the mix was not always good and even sometimes difficult to hack.

So when I first heard of the [CSS friendly control adapters](http://www.asp.net/css_adapters_update.htm) I thought that's my man. This morning I was able to download it and I don't know why they removed the site now, but as I have the setup I will try it over the long weekend.

CSS Rocks !!! Thanks Aurel.
