At last I get an update to my ADSL connection, I had 512/128 since the beginning (2001). I was one of the first to get ADSL in Mulhouse. I really had to push and push to get a modem. The frustrating point was that I saw all others getting faster and faster and me staying at 512/128. I tried several time to change but I was always said your are too far you can't get more.

Yesterday I saw that they changed the page on which you can update your abo, then I tried for the 2000th time to update and this time it was ok for 1024/256 :-) And for the same price, cool.
<!-- more -->

After one day my abo was updated and now I really have 1024/256 even with this kind of line:

***Longueur de ligne :  
* 4175 mètres**  
** 4/10 sur 3332m, 6/10 sur 843m ** 

***Affaiblissement :  
* 58.66 dB **

I know it is ridiculous compared to some friends but it is a good day for me :-).

***Didier***, the [link to update is here](http://r.orange.fr/r/Ocompteabonnement?ref=menuMC) ;-)

***Philippe***, please stop laughing.
