I like very much the idea of a [.NET Generic Host in the MSDN documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/host/generic-host?view=aspnetcore-3.0):

> An object that encapsulates an app's resources, such as:
>  * Dependency injection (DI)
>  * Logging
>  * Configuration
>  * IHostedService implementations
<!-- more -->

The origin of .NET Generic Host is [Microsoft.Extensions](https://github.com/aspnet/Extensions), a set of .NET APIs for commonly used programming patterns and utilities, such as dependency injection, logging, and application configuration.

Why do I like this idea? Because it means that whatever application you are building using .NET Generic Host, it will always bring all of those services freely in a consistent manner. The application can be an ASP.NET Core application, which is where the idea of Web Host emerged and was refined into a Generic Host.

But, **why couldn't a WPF application be build using it?** The current WPF template doesn't use .NET Generic Host! Never the less, let's modify the code generated by the WPF template to leverage it.

The goal is to have a tiny .NET Core 3.0 WPF application demonstrating each of Dependency injection (DI), Logging and Configuration.

# Default WPF template

We need to modify the App.xaml so that it doesn't use StartupUri. Which sets the UI; MainWindow.xaml, that is automatically shown when an application starts. Our goal is to be able to create the Window ourself, using the IOC container, so that we can inject services!

We replace *StartupUri* by *Startup* calling *Application_Startup* and when we are at it, we also add *Exit* and *Application_Exit*. This will let us know when the application starts/stops so that we can start/stop the host.

```xml {data-file=App.xaml}
<Application x:Class="wpfGenericHost.App"
             xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
             xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
             xmlns:local="clr-namespace:wpfGenericHost"
             Startup="Application_Startup"
             Exit="Application_Exit">
    <Application.Resources />         
</Application>
```

```csharp {data-file=App.xaml.cs}
public partial class App : Application
{
    public App()
    {
    }

    private void Application_Startup(object sender, StartupEventArgs e)
    {
    }

    private void Application_Exit(object sender, ExitEventArgs e)
    {
    }
}
```

The App constructor seems to be the right place to build our new Host. *Application_Startup* the place to start the host and *Application_Exit* the place to stop the host.

```csharp {data-file=App.xaml.cs}
public partial class App : Application
{
    private IHost _host;

    public App()
    {
        _host = new HostBuilder().Build();
    }

    private async void Application_Startup(object sender, StartupEventArgs e)
    {
        await _host.StartAsync();
    }

    private async void Application_Exit(object sender, ExitEventArgs e)
    {
        using (_host)
        {
            await _host.StopAsync(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5));
        }
    }
}
```

# Dependency injection (DI)

A first capability that .NET Generic Host is bringing is Dependency injection. We can inject some dependencies to the *MainWindow* as we delegate it's creation to the IOC container in *Application_Startup*. In this example, we are injecting a simple interface called *ITextService* with one method *GetText()*.

<?! alert info ?>
In a real application, we definitely would be able to inject a View Model like *MainWindowViewModel* which would itself have other dependencies provided by the IOC container.
<?!/ alert ?>

```csharp {data-file=MainWindow.xaml.cs}
public partial class MainWindow : Window
{
    public MainWindow(ITextService textService)
    {
        InitializeComponent();

        Label.Content = textService.GetText();
    }
}
```

```csharp {data-file=App.xaml.cs}
public partial class App : Application
{
    private IHost _host;

    public App()
    {
        _host = new HostBuilder()
                    .ConfigureServices((context, services) =>
                    {
                        services.AddSingleton<ITextService, TextService>();
                        services.AddSingleton<MainWindow>();
                    })
                    .Build();
    }

    private async void Application_Startup(object sender, StartupEventArgs e)
    {
        await _host.StartAsync();

        var mainWindow = _host.Services.GetService<MainWindow>();
        mainWindow.Show();
    }

    ...
}
```

# Configuration

The second capability of .NET Generic Host we want to explore is Configuration. We want to build the concrete implementation of *ITextService* with a dependency on an external configuration to get the text to display in the main window.

The configuration is handled by a concrete class called *Settings* and the *appsettings.json* configuration file. Both have a property called *Text*.

```csharp {data-file=Settings.cs}
public class Settings
{
    public string Text { get; set; }
}
```

```json {data-file=appsettings.json}
{
    "Text": "Hello WPF .NET Core 3.0\nfrom .NET Generic Host!"
}
```

```csharp {data-file=TextService.cs}
class TextService : ITextService
{
    private string _text;

    public TextService(IOptions<Settings> options)
    {
        _text = options.Value.Text;
    }

    public string GetText()
    {
        return _text;
    }
}
```

We register the *Settings* class in the IOC container so that it is resolved and injected as *IOptions<Settings>* in our concrete class *TextService*.

```csharp {data-file=App.xaml.cs}
public partial class App : Application
{
    private IHost _host;
    private readonly Settings _settings;


    public App()
    {
        _host = new HostBuilder()
                    .ConfigureAppConfiguration((context, configurationBuilder) =>
                    {
                        configurationBuilder.SetBasePath(context.HostingEnvironment.ContentRootPath);
                        configurationBuilder.AddJsonFile("appsettings.json", optional: false);
                    })
                    .ConfigureServices((context, services) =>
                    {
                        services.Configure<Settings>(context.Configuration);

                        services.AddSingleton<ITextService, TextService>();
                        services.AddSingleton<MainWindow>();
                    })
                    .Build();
    }
    ...
}
```

# Logging

The final capability of .NET Generic Host we want to have a look at is Logging. In our simple example, we will just add the possibility to output logs to the Console. Again, we are injecting an *ILogger* into our concrete class *TextService* to be able to write a piece of information to our logs.

```csharp {data-file=TextService.cs}
class TextService : ITextService
{
    private string _text;

    public TextService(IOptions<Settings> options, ILogger<TextService> logger)
    {
        _text = options.Value.Text;

        logger.LogInformation($"Text read from settings: '{options.Value.Text}'");
    }

    public string GetText()
    {
        return _text;
    }
}
```

```csharp {data-file=App.xaml.cs}
public partial class App : Application
{
    private IHost _host;

    public App()
    {
        _host = new HostBuilder()
                    .ConfigureAppConfiguration((context, configurationBuilder) =>
                    {
                        configurationBuilder.SetBasePath(context.HostingEnvironment.ContentRootPath);
                        configurationBuilder.AddJsonFile("appsettings.json", optional: false);
                    })
                    .ConfigureServices((context, services) =>
                    {
                        services.Configure<Settings>(context.Configuration);

                        services.AddSingleton<ITextService, TextService>();
                        services.AddSingleton<MainWindow>();
                    })
                    .ConfigureLogging(logging =>
                    {
                        logging.AddConsole();
                    })
                    .Build();
    }
    ...
}
```

# Result

We can run the application and see that *MainWindow* is created using the *TextService* which read the *Text* property of *appsettings.json* and our WPF application correctly displays the text.

# Conclusion

We have seen all the benefits the .NET Generic Host is bringing. It was easy to integrate into WPF applications, even if Microsoft is not currently providing a .NET Core template for that particular usage. But it seems that the idea is open to discussion, you can read more about it on Github issue "[Make Future WPF IoC Friendly #499](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/499)".

You can get all the code on GitHub
