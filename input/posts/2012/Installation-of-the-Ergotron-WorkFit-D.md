In late 2010 I reworked my home office and installed a new [Ergotron LX Dual Side-by-Side Arm](http://www.laurentkempe.com/post/Installation-of-Ergotron-LX-Dual-Side-by-Side-Arm.aspx), to gain some place on my desk.

Some months ago, after different discussions with my colleague Bojan I decided to go on and try to find an height adjustable desk, which he just installed in his home office. I didn’t quite like his one because it was with an electrical motor and I prefered to find a mechanical one. It started to be important for me to stand during the day/night that I spend in front of a computer. I have back pains since years, and it is really time that I do something about it. You might read more about the topic on “[JustStand.org](http://www.juststand.org/ResearchandNews/tabid/636/language/en-US/Default.aspx)” or on “[Sitting is killing you](http://www.medicalbillingandcoding.org/sitting-kills/)”. 

I also wanted to have something which fits nicely with my LX Dual Side-by-Side Arm and finally I found what I was looking for; the [WorkFit-D, Sit-Stand Desk](http://www.ergotron.com/Products/tabid/65/PRDID/511/language/en-US/Default.aspx) from [Ergotron](http://www.ergotron.com/).

Here is the impressive packaging I received

And what was inside the box

The mounting documentation was really easy to follow and after almost an hour I had my new Ergotron WorkFit-D assembled and my LX Dual Side-by-Side Arm with it’s two 24 inches monitor mounted on it. As for the mounting of the arm there was really nothing that I disliked during the mounting, easy and clear.

So over the past month, I had the chance to use this new working environment while working from home.

First of all I tend to use more the [LX Dual Side-by-Side Arm](http://www.laurentkempe.com/post/Installation-of-Ergotron-LX-Dual-Side-by-Side-Arm.aspx) to adjust my monitors when I change from standing up to sitting or the opposite. Before on the fixed desk with the chair, the arm saved quite some place on the desk, so I didn’t had really to move them when I needed to do something else then being on the PC. This is really **easy and fast with the arm**.

Going from the sitting position to the standing is really **fast, smooth and easy**. I just have to deal better with the cables behind which sometime cause problem, but I think I have a solution which I will try by end of this week. I was quite surprise that it was that easy, because the two monitors aren’t that light weight.

I used at the beginning the [Neo-Flex® Underdesk Keyboard Arm](http://www.ergotron.com/Products/tabid/65/PRDID/470/language/en-US/Default.aspx) to have my wireless keyboard and mouse. But I stopped at the moment because the whole set was shaking too much when I was typing. I still need to fine tune the foots of the WorkFit-D, which I think will improve the stability and reduce the shaking. 

What was a surprise to me was the speed at which I went from a whole day sitting to almost a **whole day standing**. It took me less than a month. For example today I worked the whole day standing. I still have some pain in my legs after a full day but I think it improves slowly.

During Christmas I worked with my brother [Mathieu](http://myaustraliantrip.blogspot.fr/) on our new personal project and we found that it was a **fantastic setup for pair programming**.

So, **I like very much my new Ergotron WorkFit-D and the LX Dual Side-by-Side every day and night** I am working home.

I still have some work to do to have my home office the way I want it, but this is work in progress.
