I love my [Microsoft Bluetooth Mobile Keyboard 6000](http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/d/bluetooth-mobile-keyboard-6000). I have one at home and one at work.

But there is two things which I don’t really like as a developer:
<!-- more -->

1.  No contextual menu key 
2.  Two keys combination for Home and End   

So I searched for a solution and found one at least for the contextual menu key. The solution is named [SharpKey](http://sharpkeys.codeplex.com/).

> SharpKeys is a utility that manages a Registry key that allows Windows to remap one key to any other key. Included in the application is a list of common keyboard keys and a Type Key feature to automatically recognize most keyboard keys.

This little tool let me remap the Caps Lock, which no one use right? to the the contextual menu key, which makes my developer life much easier as I don’t need to move my hand from the keyboard to the mouse to get to that menu.

Great improvement!

At the moment I don’t have found a better way for the Home and End key, but I am considering remapping the volume up and volume down.
