ChevronWP7 Labs just realized their Windows Phone unlocking tool. This software will let you developer unlock your device for $9. 
<!-- more -->

This is not a Jailbreaking tool, it let you upload your own homebrew applications on your Windows Phone 7 device without going through Microsoft's expensive ($99/year) developer program.

You might read more about it on their blog : [ChevronWP7 Labs Availability](http://www.chevronwp7.com/post/12328024419/chevronwp7-labs-availability)

Still waiting that the 295 people in front of me get their phones unlockedâ€¦ !

**Update**: And here is the result after unlocking !

I also quickly deployed successfully an application to the phone directly from Visual Studio 2010 !

Congrats to the ChevronWP7 team !
