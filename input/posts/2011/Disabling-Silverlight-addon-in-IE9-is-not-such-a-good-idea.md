The other day I disabled Silverlight add-on in IE9. Don’t ask me why I don’t really remember, and I prefer not.

Several days after that I started an out of the browser application, ClickTime which we use to report our hours. And I got a weird JavaScript error a la IE with a white window and the picture asking me to install Silverlight. I checked that it was still installed and it was, no problem.
<!-- more -->

Then I uninstalled it and reinstalled it! Same issue.

It took me time to remember that I disabled the Silverlight add-on in IE9 and for sure when I enabled it, then the out of browser applications were working again and I didn’t get anymore this install Silverlight picture.
