My friend [**Mitsu**](https://twitter.com/mitsufu) just posted a [funny demo](http://blogs.msdn.com/mitsu/archive/2009/02/13/coding4fun-understanding-winforms-designmode.aspx) about what you can do in the Visual Studio designer. He made a kind of Pong, remember that old game!, just using the Visual Studio designer. Useless but so much fun! 


It was based on Silverlight, so it is not anymore available.
