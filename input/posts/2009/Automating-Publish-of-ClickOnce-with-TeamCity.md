The other day I published different posts about the way I automated our build process at [Innoveo Solutions](http://www.innoveo.com/) to generate different ClickOnce setup using [TeamCity](http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/index.html):

Yesterday I was asked to solve one minor issue. At ClickOnce publishing time the publish.htm file was not generated so the ClickOnce version number on the web page wasnâ€™t shown. The publish.htm file is a static file on the targeted deploy directory and IIS uses that file. The file contains a hard coded version 2.0.0.x.

So from a user perspective it was difficult to know if there were a new version. So I was asked to show the correct version.

I knew from past research a way to handle this from the following post: [How To: Generate publish.htm with MSBuild](http://blogs.msdn.com/mwade/archive/2009/02/28/how-to-generate-publish-htm-with-msbuild.aspx)

But I went to a more pragmatic solution, as I already had the [MSBuild Community Tasks](http://msbuildtasks.tigris.org/).

I made a copy of Publish.htm to Publish.htm.ori on each targeted deploy directory.

Then I modified my MSBuild script to do the following:

1.  Copy Publish.html.ori to Publish.htm
2.  Use FileUpdate of [MSBuild Community Tasks](http://msbuildtasks.tigris.org/) to search the 2.0.0.x string and replace it with the version 

```xml
<!-- Deploy Click Once-->
<Target Name="DeployClickOnce">

  <Message Text="####### Deploy ClickOnce $(Configuration)|$(Platform)  ---------#" />

  <Exec Command="xcopy /E /Y $(ClickOnceSrc)*.* $(ClickOnceDestination)" />

  <Copy SourceFiles="$(ClickOnceDestination)\Publish.htm.ori"
        DestinationFiles="$(ClickOnceDestination)\Publish.htm" />

  <FileUpdate Files="$(ClickOnceDestination)\Publish.htm"
              Regex="2.0.0.x"
              ReplacementText="$(FullVersion)" />

</Target>
```

and the FullVersion is defined as this, using TeamCity [BUILD_VCS_NUMBER](http://www.jetbrains.net/confluence/display/TCD4/Predefined+Properties), which is Latest VCS revision:

```xml
<Major>2</Major>
<Minor>0</Minor>
<Build>0</Build>
<Revision>$(BUILD_VCS_NUMBER_app_Trunk)</Revision>
<FullVersion>\((Major).\)(Minor).\((Build).\)(Revision)</FullVersion>
```  

And now the Publish webpage display the version correctly!
