From quite some time I had a crash when running the ATI Catalyst installer and I finally found what was the issue.

I followed the KB and then I could run again the installer without any issue.

Another good news is that ATI release now installers for notebooks. We donâ€™t need anymore to tweak there installer using [Mobility DotNET Final1.1.1.0](http://www.driverheaven.net/modtool.php). 

For example I could find the installer for my [FireGL V5200](http://support.amd.com/us/psearch/Pages/psearch.aspx?type=2.4.3&product=2.4.3.3.2.3.9&contentType=GPU+Download+Detail&ostype=Windows+Vista+-+32-Bit+Edition&keywords=&items=20).
