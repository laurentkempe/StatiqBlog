[Laurent Bugnion](http://blog.galasoft.ch/Default.aspx) just published [MVVM Light Toolkit V3 Alpha 3](http://mvvmlight.codeplex.com) which support WPF 4 and Silverlight 4!

I published, yesterday a short post in French on my [Tech Head Brothers](http://www.techheadbrothers.com/) portal about [Silverlight 4 Beta, Drop Target et MVVM](http://www.techheadbrothers.com/Astuces.aspx/silverlight-4-beta-drop-target-mvvm) which shows the usage of this new version of EventToCommand combined with Silverlight 4 Drop Target.

I will post more about the new features in this alpha version, but the most exciting is probably that with this release, the MVVM Light Toolkit works in **Windows Presentation Foundation 4 and in Silverlight 4** (in Visual Studio 2010).

> There is no automatic installer for this version yet, but I wrote [a page describing how to install manually](http://galasoft.ch/mvvm/installing/manually/) (it is as easy as unzipping a few files). All the features are also available for Visual Studio 2008 as usual.
> 
> The [source code was also updated](http://mvvmlight.codeplex.com/SourceControl/ListDownloadableCommits.aspx) on the Codeplex website.
> 
> More documentation will follow soon so stay tuned. In the mean time, have fun with MVVM in WPF4/SL4!
