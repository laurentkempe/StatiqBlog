I am always loosing time searching for that information when we get an update of office templates, so I decided to make a ‘note to self’ so that I will not loose anymore time with that.

Start Word 2007 and go on Word Options, then click Advanced, File Locations:

Original location: C:\Users\{your username}\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates

In that location create a shortcut to your template folder, but keep the selected original path:

Now you should have access to your templates like this:

With this way of doing you might get multiple template folders.
