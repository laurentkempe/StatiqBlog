With a very nice timing Microsoft team just published [ASP.NET MVC RC](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=141184&clcid=0x409) !

We started over Christmas a migration of our .NET French Portal, [Tech Head Brothers](http://www.techheadbrothers.com/), to ASP.NET MVC. We had lots of fun and a great experience to be able to do collocated pair programming over that time.
<!-- more -->

We also started another project on the side with a third developer (hey Mark) and a designer (hey Ally) and you will hear more about it soon hopefully! It will for sure use ASP.NET MVC also.

To read more about this new release, please check out the [ASP.NET MVC official site](http://www.asp.net/mvc/default.aspx), ScottGu mega epic post “[ASP.NET MVC 1.0 Release Candidate Now Available](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2009/01/27/asp-net-mvc-1-0-release-candidate-now-available.aspx)” or [Phil Haack](http://haacked.com/articles/AboutHaacked.aspx) “[ASP.NET MVC Release Candidate](http://haacked.com/archive/2009/01/27/aspnetmvc-release-candidate.aspx)”.

And don’t forget to take a look to [ASP.NET MVC RC 1 Futures](http://www.codeplex.com/aspnet/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=22359).
