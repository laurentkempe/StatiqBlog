I installed Windows 7 the day after it was released on MSDN. I am discovering daily new things that improve my productivity and I am really delighted about it.

Today I was back to work at [Innoveo Solutions](http://www.innoveo.com/) and adding the HP Color Laserjet 5500 printer was just so easy but the best was that we can now manage default printers per network. At home I have a HP Laserjet 4000 that is set as my default printer when I connect my notebook to my home LAN. When I connect to the Innoveo Solutions LAN my default printer is set automatically to the HP Color Laserjet 5500 printer. It might be a detail, but in the past it happened several time, doing home office and printing on the office printer when I wanted to print on the home printer.

With Windows 7 it is really easy to configure, click on the **Start **button then **Devices and Printers**, you will get to that dialog:

Click on the Manage default printers and you will get a second dialog in which you can click **Change my default printer when I change networks** and configure which printer belongs to which network:

Simple and easy.
