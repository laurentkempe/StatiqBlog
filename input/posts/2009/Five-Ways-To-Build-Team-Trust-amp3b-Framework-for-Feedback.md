I am for quite some time now working on the Agile subject and tonight I read two very interesting posts that I wanted to share and keep track of.

The first one was posted by **Mike Bria** on [InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com/) and is called [Five Ways To Build Team Trust](http://www.infoq.com/news/2009/04/derby-building-trust), in which advises are given to help trust form within teams.

1.  1.  **Address Issues Directly.**
    2.  **Share Relevant Information.**
    3.  **Follow Through on Commitments or Give Early Notice When You Can't.**
    4.  **Say No When You Mean No.**
    5.  **Show What You Know and What You Don't Know.**   

The second post, “[How I learned about Feedback](http://ellnestam.wordpress.com/2009/04/14/how-i-learned-about-feedback/)” is from **[Ola Ellnestam](http://ellnestam.wordpress.com/about/)**, Agile Coach, Systems developer, Agile Practitioner, and is an excellent report on experiences applying a “feedback framework” learned from a workshop held by [Esther Derby](http://estherderby.com/) and [Diana Larsen](http://futureworksconsulting.com/).

> ##### **Framework for feedback**
> 
> Esther Derby and Diana Larsen introduced me to a ‘Framework For Giving Feedback’. It looks like this.
> 
> *   Create an opening
> *   Describe the behavior or results
> *   State the impact
> *   Make a request
> 
> I find this framework very easy to use and powerful. So, when I’m about to give feedback in tough or new situations I try to run through the scenario in my head, creating an imaginary outcome of the conversation. This has helped me several times. Lets look at the ‘meeting issue’ again.

Enjoy
