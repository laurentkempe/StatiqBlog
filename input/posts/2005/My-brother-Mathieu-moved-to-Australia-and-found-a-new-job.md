As you might know my brother [Mathieu moved to Australia](http://myaustraliantrip.blogspot.com/) at 
the begining of this year. After some time visiting the country ([The 
Northern Territory](http://myaustraliantrip.blogspot.com/2005/06/northern-territory.html), [Les 
WithSundays et les environs de Cairn](http://myaustraliantrip.blogspot.com/2005/05/les-withsundays-et-les-environs-de.html), [Byron 
Bay](http://myaustraliantrip.blogspot.com/2005/04/byron-bay.html), [Les 
Blue Mountains](http://myaustraliantrip.blogspot.com/2005/03/les-blue-mountains.html), [Innisfail 
et les bananes](http://myaustraliantrip.blogspot.com/2005/05/innisfail-et-les-bananes.html)), he started searching for a job and finally found one in 
Perth. **Congratulation** [Mathieu](http://www.techheadbrothers.com/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabindex=7&tabid=19&id=3) 
!!! I am really proud of what you are doing.

I told you Mathieu that there is no wifi in the bush ;-)

I saw that picture in the train station of Basel/Switzerland with [Didier](http://www.didierbeck.com/) driving to work and we laught 
so much that I had to post it. In fact the picture is an advert. How could it 
represents better a IT job in Australia ?
