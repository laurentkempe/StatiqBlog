We have seen in the first tips ["Fast access 
to Workspaces"](http://weblogs.asp.net/lkempe/archive/2005/05/21/408188.aspx), in this one we will see how to access a file saved in file 
tool from one workspace. It happens that you are using a file often, and it 
starts to be boring to open the correct workspace, then the correct file tool in 
that worksapce, even with the [Tips 1](http://weblogs.asp.net/lkempe/archive/2005/05/21/408188.aspx). 
So what you can do is:

1.  Open the workspace, then open the file tool where your file is saved 
  Right click on the file and choose Send To / Desktop (create shortcut) 
    
<!-- more -->

  Go on your desktop, you will find the shortcut

  Rename the file
  Now you can access the file directly on your desktop, but you might also 
  copy it to one of your folder in the My Groove created in the [Tips 
1](http://weblogs.asp.net/lkempe/archive/2005/05/21/408188.aspx).
  When you clik on the shortcut, if groove is running it will open the 
  workspave, then the file, if it is not open it will start groove 
before.
