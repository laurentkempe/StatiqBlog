That's something I was saying at the minute I saw the first time Virtual 
Office.  

Ok, first step is to have Virtual Office in the Office System. 
The next step is to have it at the OS level. Imagine scenarios using distributed 
workspace in which you are able to add user easily, to share content on a peer 
to peer basis with all workspace's users, to communicate with voice over ip, 
presence, messaging... Now add to this the power of WinFS or Msn Deskbar, and 
integrate it in the OS with look and feel of longhorn. My opinionÂ is that 
it will absolutely change the way people are working together. A revolution is 
starting.
