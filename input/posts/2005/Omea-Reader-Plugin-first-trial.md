I started to develop an [Omea 
Reader](http://www.jetbrains.com/omea/reader/) Plugin using Omea OpenAPI. The OpenAPI is a set of tools, 
documentation and sample code which can be used for developing Omea plugins. The 
current version of the OpenAPI is available here: [Omea-OpenAPI-1.0.3.zip](http://download.jetbrains.com/omea/Omea-OpenAPI-1.0.3.zip) (1 
MB). The development is straight forward, I like the API.

My idea is to bring the content that I aggregate in Omea to another tool that 
I am using.  
<!-- more -->
More to come...
