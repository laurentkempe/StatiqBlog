"Rick Ross, founder of Javalobby, talks about our recent trip to the 
Microsoft campus in Redmond Washington for the Technology Summit 2005. This 
gathering of developers from a variety of platforms yielded some interesting 
insights from all parties. Listen on for Rick's overview and thoughts on the 
summit.

From Rick: "I am encouraging **mutual respect** and a 
**dialogue** to keep the possibility for progress alive. Frozen 
hatred is not in the best interests of the Java developer community."

"I want it to be explicitly clear that I am NOT advocating any Java developer 
to abandon Java. I am only saying that we should consider, as a community, 
treating our **peer developers** in the Microsoft world and 
elsewhere with more **respect** and 
**open-mindedness**."

Nothing to add. You said everything Rick !!!
