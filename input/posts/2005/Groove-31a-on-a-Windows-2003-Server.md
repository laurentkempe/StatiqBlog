I updated my Windows 2003 server with the latest [Groove Virtual Office](http://www.groove.net) version 3.1a (3.1.1.2364) and now it doesn't crash anymore at start time. I was told that this version supports Windows 2003 but I can't find anything online saying so.

Why having it on a Windows 2003 Server ?

1.  I have one at home, it is used has a backup for some Groove Workspaces
2.  [Integrating virtual office solutions](http://www.groove.net/solutions/develop/dev2.cfm)Â with the [Groove Web Services API](http://components.groove.net/Groove/DailyBuilds/GDKlatest/GrooveWSDevelopmentKit.exe) 

As described on the site, "The Groove Web Services API allows you to develop custom applications that integrate Groove Virtual Office workspace data and/or Groove platform services with external applications."

Imagine a scenario where someone fill in a Web Form. The web site hosting the Web Form would then connect to a Groove Instance on a Server and save the data in a Workspace. The data would then be available to all user of the worksapce. Great !!! And that's just a simple scenario.
