This evening (hum morning ;) I decided to give a try to the conversion wizard integrated in Visual Studio 2005 that let you import older 1.1 projects.  
I chose to import my whole website: [Tech Head Brothers](http://www.techheadbrothers.com "Tech Head Brothers"). You might see next the conversion report:

And the Error List report of a build :

I am impressed about the conversion. Ok I have 2 errors and 133 Warnings, but 
the warnings are all due to deprecated classes or obsolete methods and the 
two errors are:

*   Error 134 Program `\Projects\Tech Head Brothers Portal\Database\obj\Debug\Database.exe` does not contain a static `Main` method suitable for an entry point Database
*   Error 135 Program `\Projects\Tech Head Brothers Portal\Docs\obj\Debug\Docs.exe` does not contain a static `Main`**** method suitable for an entry point Docs

Next step is to get the DB in SQL Server 2005 and make some tests. But that the task for another day.

Tomorrow I will be at the French DevDays 2005 in Strasbourg, hope to meet you there.
