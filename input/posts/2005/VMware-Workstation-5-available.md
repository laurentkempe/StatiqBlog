The long awaited virtualization product is finally available on VMware site: 
[VMware 
Workstation 5](https://www.vmware.com/products/desktop/ws_features.html). I have succesfully updated my license form 4.5 to 5 for free 
and I am currently downloading it. I tried the beta of the 5 version with the 
possibility to import [Microsoft Virtual 
PC](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtualpc/default.mspx) and was surprised that it worked so well. Now to say which one is 
faster... I would say that it is difficult to see differences in speed, at least 
with my Visual Studio 2005 tests.
