What can you expect from the Beta Experience?
<!-- more -->

*   Visual Studio 2005 Team System Beta 2 
  Team Foundation Server Beta 2 
  WeFly247 training DVD 
  SQL Server 2005 Standard Edition Community Technology Preview 
  The Beta Experience newsletter (6-weekly, terminated with the launch of 
  the final version of Visual Studio 2005)


I hope that this time Team Foundation can be installed on one VPC.
