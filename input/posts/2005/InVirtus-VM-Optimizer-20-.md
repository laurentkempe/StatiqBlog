I am using VM for a while now, most of the time to have alpha, ctp, beta...

My issue was that my main VM was starting to be really big: 8.5Gb and I had to do something to save some disk space.

Some weeks ago I read about [InVirtus VM Optimizer 2.0](http://www.invirtus.com/), and this weekend I was able to download there [14 days evaluation version](http://www.invirtus.com/component/option,com_wrapper/Itemid,51/). Installation was so easy and the result is that now my VM is 5Gb and loads faster. Great tool!!!
