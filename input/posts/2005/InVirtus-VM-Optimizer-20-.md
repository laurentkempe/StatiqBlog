<font face="Verdana" size="2">I am using VM for a while now, most of the time to 
have alpha, ctp, beta...</font>

<font face="Verdana" size="2">My issue was that my main VM was starting to be 
really big: 8.5Gb and I had to do something to save some disk space.</font>
<!-- more -->

<font face="Verdana" size="2">Some weeks ago I read about </font><font face="Verdana" size="2">[<font face="Verdana" size="2">InVirtus VM Optimizer 2.0</font>](http://www.invirtus.com/), and this weekend I was 
able to download there [14 days 
evaluation version](http://www.invirtus.com/component/option,com_wrapper/Itemid,51/). Installation was so easy and the result is that now my 
VM is 5Gb and loads faster. Great tool!!!</font>
