Without SP1. I hadÂ an [Issue with 
my W2k3 server after SP1 installation](http://weblogs.asp.net/lkempe/archive/2005/04/04/397084.aspx), I could not fix it, so I went back 
with booting on the installation DVD, choosing to install Windows 2003 than 
repair the existing installation, and then finally I had to install the 35 
patches. And now it is working again :-).
