If you are like me and you are using Groove. I recommend you to read [Marc Olson's 
Groove "12" Blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/marco/archive/2005/11/15/493058.aspx).  
Tomorrow Marc will blog about the integration of 
InfoPath and Groove 12, such an integration is so promising.

<!-- more -->
By the way, Mark (if you read my post) I would like to know why some of the 
features of Groove are not considered to be integrated at the OS level rather 
then in Office.
