> Windows Desktop Search, which is installed with MSN Search Toolbar, will 
  find anything on your computer ; e-mail messages, calendar appointments, 
  photos, documents, and more. Searching your computer is as fast and easy as 
  searching the Web, and the Desktop Search results window includes rich Windows 
  Explorer features, such as multi-select, right-click, and drag-and-drop 
  functionality.

> Windows Desktop Search can be extended to index the contents of new file 
  types and data sources. The user interface can be extended by associating 
  icons and context-menu handlers with those items.
> 
> Also, queries can be passed into the Windows Desktop Search application and 
  returned so that other applications can display the result sets from within 
  the application.

The first things that pop-up was [Groove](http://www.groove.net/). 
It would be really great to be able to search accross all groove workspaces to 
find documents, discussions entries, pictures... I think that [Groove](http://www.groove.net/) would be a fantastic new data 
source.

The only problem is that you need to implement the data source in C++, back 
to the roots.
