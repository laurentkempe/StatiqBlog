I just started google to find out my NFOP article on Tech Head Brothers, and 
guess what I found that again someone copied content from my site without asking 
me and without any reference to the original author, in that case me.
<!-- more -->

I really hate that, I mean you spend time to create a website, to devlop it, 
to produce content, ok because you like that, but at least there should be a 
minimum respect about that.

So here is my original article:  
[Utilitaire 
basé sur NFop  
Génération de fichier PDF avec .NET.](http://www.techheadbrothers.com/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabindex=1&tabid=7&AId=20) 

And here is the copy:  
[Comment générer un pdf à partir 
d'un fichier Word Doc en ASP.net?](http://harmegniesp.phidji.com/pdf_doc.htm)

If you haven't seen on the bottom of all Tech Head Brothers pages there 
is a **copyright** !!! On the site all articles are 
**copyrighted** by there author, and the whole site is also 
**copyrighted**.

Surfing on the site that is copying my article, I could find a name: [Patrice 
Harmegnies](http://harmegniesp.phidji.com/curriculum/cv.asp) and emails:  
[patrice.harmegnies@skynet.be](mailto:patrice.harmegnies@skynet.be?subject=Re%20CV)  
[harmegniesp@tiscalinet.be  
](mailto:harmegniesp@tiscalinet.be?subject=Re%20CV)[hpph.net@tiscali.be](mailto:hpph.net@tiscali.be)  
even a 
picture:

## <font color="crimson">If you find that way of copying not normal, please email 
that person to tell him to stop doing so. Thanks for your support.</font>
