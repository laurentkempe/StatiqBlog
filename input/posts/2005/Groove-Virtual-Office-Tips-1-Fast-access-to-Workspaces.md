[Groove](http://www.groove.net/) Launchbar is great but sometimes 
it simply takes too much time to open it to get to a workspace. 

1.  Go with Explorer in your My Documents folder, Create a folder and call it 
    **My Groove**
<!-- more -->
2.  You might create in your My Groove Folder other Folders to classify your 
  worksapces
3.  Open Groove Launchbar
4.  Select one workspace and drag it to the explorer folder you just created, 
  you get automatically a shortcut to that workspace
5.  Continue doing so for all workspace you want to have access to
6.  Right click on the taskbar and choose in the context menu Toolbars / New 
  Toolbar, in new dialog browse to My Documents / My Groove, click OK


You now have a new Toolbar called My Groove in window's taskbar that let you 
choose a Workspace without running the Groove Launchbar.
