I started to develop a plugin for [Omea Reader](http://www.jetbrains.com/omea/), as you can read on 
theÂ [previous 
post](http://weblogs.asp.net/lkempe/archive/2005/02/09/370073.aspx).  
This plugin lets you select an entry in Omea Reader and send it to 
a [Groove](http://www.groove.net/) Discussion tool.  
I have used [Groove Web Services 
Development Kit](http://www.groove.net/solutions/develop/downloads.cfm), and in an 2 hours effort I could have the first release of 
the plugin running.

I was searching for such a solution to send messages I 
read in newsgroups to Groove Discussion tool, so now I have one. For sure I have 
to finalize it first, but here is a first screenshot of the result:
