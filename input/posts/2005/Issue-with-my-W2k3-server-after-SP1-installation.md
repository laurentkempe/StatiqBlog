The server is booting till the w2k3 boot screen then it resets and reboot 
  
in a loop.  
Booting in safe mode ends with the same effect. When I boot in 
safe mode   
<!-- more -->
I can see that the last thing that is loaded is acpitabl.dat  
So 
I went to the BIOS and configured the BIOS with setting saying that the   
OS 
is not ACPI. Now when I reboot I get the DOS progress bar before the W2K3 
  
booting logo and it locks at the end of the progress bar.

I would really appreciate some help. Thanks.
