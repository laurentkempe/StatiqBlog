This evening I attended a webcast about web service 
interopearability. It was done by [Michele 
Leroux Bustamante](http://www.dasblonde.net/) of [IDesign](http://www.idesign.net/idesign/DesktopDefault.aspx). The 
subject was .NET and Bea Weblogic interop and was really interesting. I would 
like to see now the way to do the same development using Eclipse and deploying 
the Web service in Weblogic. One of the link to remember about this webcast is: 
[Interop Warriors](http://www.interopwarriors.com/) (such a nice 
name ;).
