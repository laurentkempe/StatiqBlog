**Great news** from [Jetbrains](http://www.jetbrains.com/) tonight with the launch of the 
ReSharper 2.0 EAP started. You can download the version for Visual Studio 2003 
and Visual Studio 2005 Beta 2 and VS 2005 June CTP are supported [on this 
page](http://www.jetbrains.net/confluence/display/ReSharper/Download). I can't work anymore without that tool . There is for sure some 
refactoring capabilitiesÂ in Visual Studio 2005 Beta 2, but it is far from 
being enough.

[Build 201 (Changes from ReSharper 
1.5)](http://www.jetbrains.net/confluence/display/ReSharper/Changes)
<!-- more -->

##### [General]()

*   Support of Visual Studio 2005 (Beta 2 and June CTP are currently 
  supported) 
  Support of C# 2.0 constructs (for Visual Studio 2005) - not all constructs 
  are properly supported yet 
  Support of ASP.NET - in progress, not all features work properly 
  New preprocessor directives handling (no errors caused by use of 
  preprocessor directives anymore!) 


##### [On-the-fly Code 
Highlighting]()

*   New warning highlightings: redundant 'as' type cast; redundant empty 
  constructor; sealed member in sealed class; new virtual member in ....; 'new' 
  modifier is missing; redundant 'new' modifier; redundant boolean comparison;

  Quick-documentation feature (<b class="strong">Ctrl+Q**) shows popup with 
  documentation for symbol under caret (also works within doc-comment to show
