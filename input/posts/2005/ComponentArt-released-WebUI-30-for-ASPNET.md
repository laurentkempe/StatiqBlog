[Web.UI 3.0 for

of AJAX to deliver the most advanced set of user interface controls available 
for ASP.NET. Now featuring ALL NEW Grid, Callback and Calendar controls.

I am currently using the [Menu control](http://www.componentart.com/menu/default.aspx) from this 
ASP.NET controls suite on [Tech Head 
Brothers](http://www.techheadbrothers.com/) website. I started some trial of there suite with ASP.NET 2 and 
especially the [Callback control 
](http://www.componentart.com/CallBack/default.aspx)and was able to create a small forum in no time with Ajax/Callback getting 
each message on user click.
