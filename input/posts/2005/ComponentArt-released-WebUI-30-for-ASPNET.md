[Web.UI 3.0 for 
ASP.NET](http://www.componentart.com/products.aspx) combines ComponentArt's unique rendering technology with the power 
of AJAX to deliver the most advanced set of user interface controls available 
for ASP.NET. Now featuring ALL NEW Grid, Callback and Calendar controls.
<!-- more -->

I am currently using the [Menu control](http://www.componentart.com/menu/default.aspx) from this 
ASP.NET controls suite on [Tech Head 
Brothers](http://www.techheadbrothers.com/) website. I started some trial of there suite with ASP.NET 2 and 
especially the [Callback control 
](http://www.componentart.com/CallBack/default.aspx)and was able to create a small forum in no time with Ajax/Callback getting 
each message on user click.
