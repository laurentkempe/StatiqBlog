End of April, I was invited by Microsoft France (Thanks to [Pierre](http://blogs.developpeur.org/fox/) and [Mitsu](http://blogs.microsoft.fr/mitsufu)) to speak about the [solution](http://weblogs.asp.net/lkempe/archive/2005/01/25/360227.aspx), 
based on Word 2003, I developed to publish content on my web site [Tech Head Brothers](http://www.techheadbrothers.com). The day was 
called "Rencontres Solutions Métiers sur Office" and was held in Strasbourg, 
France. [Tech Head Brothers](http://www.techheadbrothers.com) was 
even a partner for that event.

So I arrived in Strasbourg by car and met [Mitsu](http://blogs.microsoft.fr/mitsufu). We prepared my notebook to 
be able to make the presentation. It was a nightmare to install his wifi pcmcia 
card on my notebook but after several trials it was working, but the connection 
was low. The goal of my presentation was to show the tool but to also make a 
live presentation of the publishing side of the tool with a live secured web 
service post to the site using WS-Security, WS-Policy, DIME attachment...

One of the other difficulties was that my web site was under attack since the 
weekend before the event. It was not crashing but on heavy load. It is really 
bad for such a presentation. But it went even worse...

After the pause it was our turn. Mitsu started his 30 minutes presentation 
and I was sitting on his left, trying to set my notebook to the resolution of 
the beamer that we forgot to set during the pause. After some parameterization I 
thought it was ok. So I was carefully listening to Mitsu presentation. Five 
minutes before my turn, I thought I missed one configuration for the beamer so I 
changed something, clicked apply, and boom, blue screen, on stage. At least it 
was not the screen shown on the beamer. I tell you in such condition you feel 
the adrenaline pumping up. So I quickly rebooted my machine prepared again demo, 
and at the time I was ready it was my turn to speak. After showing the 
Powerpoint presentation I made about the architecture of the tool, I started the 
demo, with lots of fear, because the wifi was showing low - very low and switch 
again and again. But believe it or not at the time I clicked the publish button, 
with finger crossed it worked. Then I could show the attendee the article 
directly on Tech Head Brothers : [Windows 
Forms : développement d'un TabControl sans onglets...](http://www.techheadbrothers.com/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabindex=1&tabid=7&AId=97) Then Mitsu 
continued his speech. And one minute after that IO had the wifi going from very 
low to disconnected. :-)

**Some times the demo god is with you, and that was such a day 
:-)**
