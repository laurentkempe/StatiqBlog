**But what are Microsoft MVP**

"The Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) Program recognizes and thanks 
outstanding members of technical communities for their community participation 
and willingness to help others. The program celebrates the most active community 
members from around the world who provide invaluable online and offline 
expertise that enriches the community experience and makes a difference in 
technical communities featuring Microsoft products.

MVPs are credible, technology experts from around the world who inspire 
others to learn and grow through active technical community participation. While 
MVPs come from many backgrounds and a wide range of technical communities, they 
share a passion for technology and a demonstrated willingness to help others. 
MVPs do this through the books and articles they author; the Web sites they 
manage; the blogs they maintain; the user groups they participate in; the chats 
they host or contribute to; the events and training sessions where they present, 
as well as through the questions they answer in technical newsgroups or message 
boards."
