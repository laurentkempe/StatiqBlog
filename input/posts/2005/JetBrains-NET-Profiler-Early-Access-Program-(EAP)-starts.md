[Jetbrains](http://www.jetbrains.com/) is opening it's early 
Access Program for it new tool [.NET 
Profiler](http://www.jetbrains.net/confluence/display/NetProf/Home;jsessionid=2D14D441FF9F196312B8F8303B583D34). Screen shot:

As I am already using [ReSharper](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/) from them and can't 
work without it anymore as you can read in older post: [Resharper 
1.0 released](http://weblogs.asp.net/lkempe/archive/2004/07/22/191622.aspx) and [Resharper 
Build 84 secret feature](http://weblogs.asp.net/lkempe/archive/2004/06/07/150356.aspx), I decided to give it a try quickly. First I thought 
I will test my website but it did not work, certainly because I use the [trick 
explained here](http://weblogs.asp.net/lkempe/archive/2004/10/17/243561.aspx) to have multiple site on Windows XP. Then I quickly 
tried [PostXING](http://projectdistributor.net/Projects/Project.aspx?projectId=12). 
I will check it a bit more and hopefully I will be able to test my web site: 
Tech Head Brothers.
