On the [JetBrain](http://www.jetbrains.com)'s [Resharper](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/) [changes page](http://www.jetbrains.net/confluence/display/ReSharper/Changes) it is written:

#### Build 84

* Documentation summary is shown in completion list and in Parameter Info (<b class="strong">Ctrl+P</b>) 
* Code completion for symbol references in doc-comments 
* Option to switch between VS icons and own ReSharper icons for symbols 
* Code style options for modifier keywords order and use of explicit private/internal modifier (and Reformat Code can reorder modifiers) 
* **A secret feature, many of you will see it in the next few days :-)**
<!-- more -->

Anyone could find what the secret feature is?
