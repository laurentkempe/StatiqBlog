<P>This morning at 1:30 AM, I reached a new milestone in the development of the publishing tool I am developing for Tech Head Brothers web site. I was able to publish content directly from Word 2003 using a Web Service secured by WS-Policy and a X509 certificate.</P>
<P>Yesterday, finally, I was able to create a X509 certificate working correctly with WSE SP2. After lots and lots of trials using makecert without any success, I tried openssl under cygwin. And guess what, the certificate was working correctly. That was the main issue I had since a while.</P>
<P>Now I am searching the way to install the public part of the certificate during the setup of the application. Any idea ?</P>
