Today I installed a virtual machine with Windows XP to be able to evaluate Groove 3.0 Beta. I am really convinced about the future of this tool and even it integration in the next operating system, at least the ideas behind. It will sign the end of the shares has we know them for today, and for sure more than that. Groove team made a huge effort on the interface I have to say and the gui is user friendly now. The speed even for a beta running on a virtual machine seems also to be far better. Still working with COM or do they switch to .NET?
