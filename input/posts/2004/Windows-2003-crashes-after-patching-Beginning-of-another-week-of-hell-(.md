In the last blog I was talking about the end of two weeks of hell ([End of two weeks of hell](http://weblogs.asp.net/lkempe/archive/2004/05/08/128425.aspx)). I thought it was the end but it starts again this week :-(

I tried to install a new Windows 2003 Standard Server. The installation works ok. Then I use Windows Update to apply the 14 needed critical updates. Then the bad things starts. It can install 4 patches but 10 failed. Then it ask me to restart the server. And at reboot I get an error message:
<!-- more -->

windows could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt: \windows\system32\config\system

Thats crazy!!! Did someone had the same issue?
