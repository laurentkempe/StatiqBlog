[Microsoft Notebook: Top exec shares business lessons](http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/200538_msftnotebook22.html)

<ul>
<li><em>It's often better to cannibalize your own business than to give someone else an opportunity to do it.</em></li>
<li><em>In some situations, your biggest competition is yourself.</em></li>
<li><em>One of the best ways to compete is to bet big on a "paradigm shift."</em></li>
<li><em>When you dominate a market and you're looking for ways to grow, adjust your thinking to enlarge the potential market you're pursuing.</em></li>
<li><em>Keep your mind open to unexpected opportunity.</em></li></ul>
