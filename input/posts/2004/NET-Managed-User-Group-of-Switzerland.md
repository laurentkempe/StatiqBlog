During my [trip to Barcelona](http://weblogs.asp.net/lkempe/archive/2004/10/20/245013.aspx), last week, I met <strong>Atif Aziz</strong>, President and Program Director, and <strong>Roman Mathis</strong>, Vice President and Membership Director, of the [<strong>.NET Managed User Group of Switzerland</strong>](http://www.dotmugs.ch/). We had several interesting discussions and I finally decided to join them in there user group as I am working in Zürich, Switzerland and there are located in the same city.<br><br>The 3 upcomings Events organized by the user group are:

<strong>[Implementing MVC with ASP.NET](http://www.dotmugs.ch/events/event.aspx?eid=31)</strong><br>02.11.2004 at 19:00, 1020 Renens      <br>Presented by Sébastien Bouchet <br>Most of the development time in a project is dedicated to the user interface, making the presentation layer architecture the backbone of any ambitious development project. An appropriate architecture should enforce maintainability, versatility and reusability. This requires fine isolation of layers with different business lifecycles, such as the look & feel, navigation and business logic. Beyond the physical code-behind model, ASP.NET does not mandate any architectural paradigm for the presentation layer so nearly every project is required to create one from scratch. The Model-View-Controller (MVC) approach is a de facto industry standard and available in most development frameworks, but what about in .NET? This sample code-driven session will discuss application of MVC in .NET, available frameworks, and in particular the Microsoft User Interface Process (UIP) Application Block. <br>

<strong>[Using HTTP Modules and Handlers to Create Pluggable ASP.NET Components](http://www.dotmugs.ch/events/event.aspx?eid=32)<br></strong>04.11.2004 at 19:00, 8700 Kusnacht <br>Presented by Atif Aziz <br>HTTP modules and handlers can be used in ASP.NET to provide a high degree of componentization for code that is orthogonal to a web application, enabling entire sets of functionalities to be developed, packaged and deployed as a single unit and independent of an application. Atif illustrates this approach by demonstration of an application-wide error logging and display facility, called ELMAH, that is completely pluggable. It can be dynamically added to a running ASP.NET web application, or even all ASP.NET web applications on a machine, without any need for re-compilation or re-deployment. Along the way, you will learn about how ASP.NET handlers and modules work, when to use them and how to implement them effectively. <br>

<strong>[Sharp Vector Graphics (SVG#)](http://www.dotmugs.ch/events/event.aspx?eid=30) </strong><br>Presented by Christian Wenz <br>23.11.2004 at 19:00, 8005 Zurich <br>Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is the official W3C standard for vector graphics on the web. Since the format is XML-based, .NET is a natural choice to dynamically generate SVG graphics. The talk introduces the SVG format, identifies advantages and disadvantages, covers the Open Source project SVG# and discusses similarities and differences between SVG and XAML.
