It is about ways to change your coding so that your code is more testable but it is also a good reminder about good design. I really liked the [article](http://www.theserverside.net/articles/showarticle.tss?id=10WaysTestableCode), nice work [Justin](http://www.gehtland.com/).

<ol>
<li>Use Interfaces</li>
<li>Define a base test class</li>
<li>As much as feasible, make everything return a value</li>
<li>Separate data access from business logic</li>
<li>Make use of configuration</li>
<li>Make Your Classes Do Only One Thing</li>
<li>Have Domain Object Factories</li>
<li>Think carefully about packaging, assemblies and namespaces</li>
<li>Pick a logging strategy early</li></ol>
