I recently participated to a great experience!!! Writing a book with 12 co-authors using Sharepoint. I wrote two chapters about the development with Visual Studio .NET 2003 for Sharepoint and one part of a chapter about the integration of Groove and Sharepoint. This book is now available, [here](http://www.lavoisier.fr/fr/livres/index.asp?texte=2746208530&select=isbn&from=Hermes).
