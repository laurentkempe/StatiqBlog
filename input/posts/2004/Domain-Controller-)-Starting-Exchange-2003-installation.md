Finally I managed to install my DC, DNS... I stopped this morning at 2 AM and restarted at 7:30 AM. Thanks to [Thierry Mille ](http://thierrymille.online.fr/minicv.html)(always of good support) and [Tim Hines](http://www.mcse.ms/message560050.html) for his message that solved my issue. Now I start installing Exchange 2003, and hope that I will be successfull. For the moment it goes ok. When it will be finished I will need to reimport my user profile, that will tough, I guess. Thanks to [Julia Lerman](http://weblogs.asp.net/jlerman/) for her kind message, thats right we are only developers ;-)
