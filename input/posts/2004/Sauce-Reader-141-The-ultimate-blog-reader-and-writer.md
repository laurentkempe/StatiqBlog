I have almost tested all blog aggregators running under Windows that I could find on the Internet. The one I was most convinced was [SharpReader](http://www.sharpreader.net/) but this has changed!!! Now I use [Sauce Reader 1.4.1](http://www.synop.com/Products/SauceReader/) and I have to say that I am fully convinced about it. The plus is that now it is able to post on [.Text](http://workspaces.gotdotnet.com/dottext) from [Scott Watermasysk](http://scottwater.com/blog/). This message was written using Sauce Reader. What a like most:

*   The Graphical User Interface (GUI)
<!-- more -->
*   Support for content in any language or character encoding
*   Posting (on .Text) with spell checking
*   Search capabilities on archived items
*   Flag blog entries
*   The fact that it is using .NET
*   Free for personal use
