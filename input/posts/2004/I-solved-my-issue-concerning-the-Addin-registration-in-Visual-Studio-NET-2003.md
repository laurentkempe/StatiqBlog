I had a problem to register new addinsÂ in Visual Studio .NET 2003 that I exposed there : [Refactoring my publishing tool](/lkempe/archive/2004/05/20/135838.aspx). When I was starting Visual Studio .NET 2003 I got this dialog:

<!-- more -->

Now it is over. If you are facing the same issue here is how I solved it:

I installed the extensibility.dll in the CAG manually:

<strong>gacutil /i "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003\Common7\IDE\PublicAssemblies\extensibility.dll"</strong>

Then reinstall or repair the addin installation with its setup. Thats it.
