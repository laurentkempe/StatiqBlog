This evening I installed on Virtual PC:

*   [Visual C# 2005 Express](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=31769&clcid=0x409)
<!-- more -->
*   [Visual Web Dev 2005 Express](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=31772&clcid=0x409)
*   [SQL Server 2005 Express](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=31773&clcid=0x409)
*   [MSDN Express Library](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=30100&clcid=0x409)


It is really funny!!! In fact I knew about those products because I saw something I should not see during the MVP Summit: a splashscreen. Then I just asked what was Express. And nobody wanted to answered me. Then during the C# presentation we were asked about a last interesting question. I raised my hand, and asked what was Express. Everybody from Microsoft was astonished to hear this word 'Express'. Then we got an answer after telling us again that we were under NDA and that it was absolute absolute secret.

I quickly tried to create a personal website with [Visual Web Dev 2005 Express](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=31772&clcid=0x409). Thats how it looks like:

There is a place for a resume:

The site looks nice. Now I need a bit more time to look in the code. If there is some ;-)
