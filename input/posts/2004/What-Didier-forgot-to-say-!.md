Thats right that we had some great time yesterday!!! But before that we worked like hell. Thursday , Friday, Monday for a total of more then 50 hours of workwith Philippe. Lorenz joined us on Monday. And today it was the same (9AM to 11PM). So I think we deserved that free half a day an dwe enjoyed it.

> We had a very hard working session yesterday (actually half a day off, with some wakeboard on the lake, more pictures to come!) in Zurich. We began with one of our special "brainstorming"...in the McDo ;-) And yes we know "[supersize me](http://www.supersizeme.com/)". And no, we don't really care ;-) <br><br>left: philippe, middle: [laurent](http://weblogs.asp.net/lkempe), right: lorenz (i'm behind the camera, the "big tasty" belongs to me) <br><br>![](http://www.didierbeck.com/pics/200408/working01.jpg)
