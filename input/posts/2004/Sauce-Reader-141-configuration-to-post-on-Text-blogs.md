After my last post about Sauce Reader I was asked by [Gavin Joyce](http://articles.gavinjoyce.com/) how to configure it to post on .Text blog. So from the menu <strong>Tools</strong> click on <strong>Weblog Accounts</strong>, a dialog popup, click on the button <strong>Add</strong> then fill in like on the following picture picture. Change RPC Path with your path and for sure username and password with yours. Thats it :-)!

**<u>Remark</u>**:**You should read in the RPC Path /lkempe/services/metablogapi.aspx !!!**
