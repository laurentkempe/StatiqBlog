I finally fixed the issue I reported in the post "[New milestone reached in the development of the authoring tool for Tech Head Brothers French portal](http://weblogs.asp.net/lkempe/archive/2004/08/23/219122.aspx) ". I am still waiting some feedback from Peter (he might be in holidays).

I am getting an exception when I try to deserialize an object. This exception is due to a security problem.
<!-- more -->

What I did is to use SGen tool from [Daniel Cazzulino](http://weblogs.asp.net/cazzu/) described in this post: "[Strongly-typed, event-rising, design-time generated custom XmlSerializers (even more than Whidbey sgen!)](http://weblogs.asp.net/cazzu/archive/2004/08/02/SGen.aspx) ". I also used Mike Woodring code described in the post: "[The Last Configuration Section Handler I'll Ever Need](http://www.pluralsight.com/craig/articleview.aspx/CLR%20Workings/The%20Last%20Configuration%20Section%20Handler%20I.xml)".Â I mixed all and modified XmlSerializerSectionHandler from Mike so that it doesn't return a fixed IDictionary but an object. With reflection I can determine which Handler to instantiate, then from this handler I call it method Create and I get something like that to deserialize an object from the configuration file:

```csharp
SchemaSettings schemaSettings = (SchemaSettings)AssemblySettings.GetConfig("SchemaSettings");
```

With the configuration:

```xml
<configuration>
    <configSections>
        <section name="SchemaSettings"
                 type="TechHeadBrothers.Configuration.XmlDynamicSerializerSectionHandler, THBPublisher"/>
    </configSections>

    <SchemaSettings type="THBPublisher.SchemaSettings, THBPublisher"
                    serializer="THBPublisher.SchemaSettingsSerializer, THBPublisher"
                    reader="THBPublisher.SchemaSettingsReader, THBPublisher">
        <Name>Laurent</Name>
    </SchemaSettings>
</configuration>
```

So the good point at the end is that I have a configuration file looking like a normal one, that I can get configuration settings from even deserialize object from it. Nice.
