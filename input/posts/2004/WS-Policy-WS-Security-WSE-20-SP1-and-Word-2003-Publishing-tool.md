This morning I woke up at 4:30 AM, and could not sleep anymore, so I decided to work on my publishing tool for my site [Tech Head Brothers](http://www.techheadbrothers.com "Tech Head Brothers"). I finally managed to publish directly from Word 2003 in a secure way. <br>The website expose a publishing web service that uses [WS-Policy](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnglobspec/html/ws-policy.asp), to specify that it needs Signature and Encryption using a X.509 certificate. When the user hit the publish button, the tool:

<ol>
<li>Transform the XML generated by Word 2003, e.g. to include pictures, colorize source code...</li>
<li>Zip the XML document and all referenced files (pictures, zip)</li>
<li>Attach the zip file using DIME to the SOAP context</li>
<li>Add signature and encryption to the SOAP context</li>
<li>Call the web service</li></ol>

Adding the WS-Policy to your web service is just a matter of some configuration using WSE 2.0 SP1, when you specify the correct certificates ;-)<br>Now I am able to get back to Word 2003 article's categories, publish, update articles and that without leaving Word 2003. <strong>Really cool !!!</strong>
