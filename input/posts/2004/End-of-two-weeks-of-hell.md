It is the end!!! And a good end :-) After two weeks of hard and long work, we have one of our applications in production. Thatâ€™s was not without difficulties. And another part that was really important is that we have a second productive Windows 2003 Server. Our backend applications running on Windows 2003 Server are now load balanced between the two servers. And it works great with a good abstraction layer that handles discovery, call and failover of the services.

The other important part of the week is that [Olympique de Marseille](http://www.olympiquedemarseille.com/Accueil/index.asp), my favorite French soccer team is in UEFA cup final. The match was great and it seems really to have a team spirit like in a non professional team. I like that and I think that [Pascal Belaud](http://blogs.msdn.com/olymars/) will not say something different.
