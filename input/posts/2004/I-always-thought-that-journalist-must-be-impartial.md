Is that not true for sport journalist ? [Canal+](http://www.canalplus.fr) showed this evening the football match Paris SG - [Olympique de Marseille](http://www.olympiquedemarseille.com/), and the journalists were really NOT impartial. That really piss me off, because I am paying an abo to get this private channel and when I see such attitude... It is even worse when you know that Canal+ invested money in Paris SG. A shame.
