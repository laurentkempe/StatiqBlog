I've got this late afternoon a popup saying that release 1.6 is out. So I updated my favorite blog tools. I will test soon the image uploading tool that i just configured. And now posting to a .Text blog is working without issue and kind of update of already posted message (erase, post). So cool.<br>Nice to see that such a company is hiring, a bit far, but who knows.
