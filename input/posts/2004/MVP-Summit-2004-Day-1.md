It starts good with a presentation of [Scott Guthrie](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/) about the new stuff in ASP.NET 2.0. Nothing really new for me because I am testing the product since some times now. But interesting new details. Then I followed with soemthing that I have not that deep knowhow: Winforms, a presentation from Joe Stegman. Really, really impresive. The next one was about ADO.NET and guess what that also have made some great development in that field. I can't tell you more cause I am under NDA, but stay tuned they are doing a great job.

Then we made some shopping, a visit to the Microsoft museumÂ and went back to the presentation of Don Box.
