I am having an issue with my groove pro accounts. I reported that to groove supprt and till that time I am waiting that they fix the issue. This evening I just made a check update from the groove interface and know it is downloading. I really hope that thiw update will fix my issue cause I can't work with my pro data since 2 weeks. More to come when the update is finished.

<u>Update</u>: I still get the same error after installing the update. I am so :-( Going to bed...
