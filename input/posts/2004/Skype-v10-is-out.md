<h2>What is Skype?</h2>


Skype is the next phenomenon from the people who brought you KaZaA. Just like KaZaA, Skype uses P2P (peer-to-peer) technology to connect you to other users – not to share files this time, but to talk and chat with your friends.

The technology is extremely advanced – but super simple to use... You’ll be making free phone calls to your friends in no time!
