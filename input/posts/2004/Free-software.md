I am reading through the different blog I subscribed to and saw that interesting entry. I have so many discussions at work concerning Free Software compared to Microsoft way of doing business with Not Free Software. Thats Life, real Life. Another way of seeing the real life is pointed by an opened letter from Clemens Vasters, [here](http://staff.newtelligence.net/clemensv/PermaLink.aspx?guid=8fe41294-a988-4c73-948a-1bfab622fcce). So true.

The Club was created to fund the development of the Mandrakelinux distribution and to <strong>pay the salaries of employees who are dedicated to</strong> "external" <strong>Free Software projects</strong> ...</em> "
