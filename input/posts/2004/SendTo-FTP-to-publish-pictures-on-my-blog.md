As you know if you read my blog I am using [Sauce Reader](http://www.synop.com/Products/SauceReader/) from [Synop](http://www.synop.com/Products/SauceReader/) to publish on my [blog](http://weblogs.asp.net/lkempe). It is a great tool, even if it needs some more work. They are really active in development and fixing issues that users are reporting. One thing I was missing on the publishing part was a way to simply add a picture to my blog. I had to start [SmartFTP](http://www.smartftp.com/) (btw a nice tool also) just to upload several pictures.
<!-- more -->

Searching an alternative on the Internet I found [<strong>SendTo FTP</strong>](http://www.pclightning.com/sndtoftp.html) by<font color="#800000"> <font color="#000000">Peili Chen </font></font>: "<em>SendTo FTP is an easy-to-use file transfer program for sending files from your local PC to a remote host, very handy and time saving for web page publishing and updating. It will make your file uploading one click away.</em>"

Now it is really easy to post pictures, and I can wait a bit more that the guys of Synop include this feature directly in their tool.

And one other point it is [Free](http://www.pclightning.com/whyfree.html)!!! Thanks Peili.
