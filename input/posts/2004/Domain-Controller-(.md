I decided to change my home installation and to promote my server as a domain controller. It is now almost 2 AM and I uninstalled it cause I made a i mistake. I didn't knew before doing that mistake that it will not migrate back the users. What a hell !!! I still have the profile on the disk but don't really know how it will react when I recreate a user. I think I will make a backup first on my external disk of the profile. I'd better learn how to do things then just trying.
