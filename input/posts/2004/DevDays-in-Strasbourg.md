Tomorrow a big part of the [Tech Head Brothers](http://www.techheadbrothers.com/) (Mathieu, Jérôme and I) will be at the Developer [Days 2004](http://www.microsoft.com/france/msdn/devdays2004/default.mspx) in Strasbourg - France. If you planned to be there please feel free to come to us to have nice discussions. Kader (also from the team) will be at the one in Paris on the 31 of March. Don't forget to have a Kiwi or two, because you will need lots of energy ;-)
