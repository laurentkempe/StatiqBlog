You will finally think that I get some money from [Synop](http://www.synop.com/) to advertise [Sauce Reader](http://www.synop.com/Products/SauceReader/) like that. It is not the case I just find the tool awesome !!! So here are the major changes and improvements in this version include:

*   <strong>Sauce Reader toolbar available in Internet Explorer</strong><em>: I am posting this blog entry with that toolbar, really cool<br>![](http://www.synop.com/Weblogs/SauceReader/content/binary/Sauce%20Reader%20v1.5%20-%20IE%20Toolbar.PNG)</em> 
<strong>Significant speed, storage and memory improvements</strong><em>: oh yeah that the case</em> 
<strong>Desktop alert when new feed items arrive</strong><em>: nice, cool and not intrusive</em> 
<strong>Complete customisation of keyboard shortcuts</strong><em>: another usefull feature </em>
<strong>Support for authenticated feeds and proxy servers</strong><em>: i will be updated at work now :-)</em> 
<strong>Improved automatic update and error reporting mechanisms</strong><em>: worked fined for the update from the alpha to the final beta</em>
