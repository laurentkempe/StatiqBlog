I have tried several tools to read blogs and to publish on mine, I wanted to have one that combines all.

<!-- more -->
* Newsgator
* Newzcrawler
* RSS Bandit
* Sharpreader

I must admit that I always came back to Sharpreader but this might change after the test of Sauce Reader. I saw some options on some ohers that are missing like the possibility to get the newsgroups (something I would really like), to be able to post pictures directly to a ftp account. The tool looks good and is developed with [.NET](http://www.microsoft.com/net/) and lots of components:

* [log4net](http://log4net.sourceforge.net/): File logging and tracing.
* [Lucene.NET](http://sourceforge.net/projects/lucenedotnet): Search engine.
* Microsoft application blocks for .NET: 
  * [Caching](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnpag/html/CachingBlock.asp): Object caching and management.
  * [Exception Management](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnbda/html/emab-rm.asp): Exception management. 
* [Updater](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnbda/html/updater.asp): Automatic application updates.
*[SharpZipLib](http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SharpZipLib/Default.aspx): Compression utilities.
