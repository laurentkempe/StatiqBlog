During the last Tech Ed in Barcelona I met [Ron Jacobs](http://blogs.msdn.com/RJacobs "His Blog") during his presentation of the <b>"Microsoft .NET Reference Building Blocks"</b> on Friday afternoon. That was really a good presentation of the main Building Blocks. Btw I like this idea of Building Blocks and will use most of them in my next release of my web site: [<b>Tech Head Bothers</b>](http://www.techheadbrothers.com/ "Tech Head Brothers"). He was kind enough after I made some pictures for him to let me go on stage to make a picture with him showing the web site in background. Cool !!!<br><br>![](/images/2004/ronjacobs.jpg)<br><br>Continue the good work with your team!!! And if you want some more pictures of your presentation just [contact me](mailto:lkempe@netcourrier.com).
