As I described in my last post I would like to have the possibility to edit only one method in the source code viewer and get to the code by browsing my class hierarchy through two windows exposing classes then methods, attributes...

Now I know why it was a problem from the guys at Microsoft to provide that feature:<br>[Code view is cut from Whidbey HTML Editor](http://weblogs.asp.net/MikhailArkhipov/archive/2004/05/24/140114.aspx)
