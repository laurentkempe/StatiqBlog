I just started to test the combination of [Jetbrains](http://www.jetbrains.com) [Omea Reader](http://www.jetbrains.com/omea) and [IMHO 1.0 Instant Blogger](http://sourceforge.net/projects/imho10). Omea 
is good when you read rss feeds and newsgroup. I like the way you can search, 
create categories, views... For the moment I couldn't find an easy way to 
quickly se the thread I started or replied to for examples in all my 
newsgroups.

Concerning IMHO, it is m y first post, so I will see after some time, but I really 
like it's simplicity.
