I worked in the fingerprint biometric business for almost 4 years and I am happy to see that Microsoft will deliver fingerprint readers. I am curious to see which company is providing the hardware, the algorithm and the software. Maybe the result of the acquisition of the [BAPI technology](http://www.iosoftware.com/pages/Products/Biometric%20API/index.asp) from [I/OSoftware](http://www.iosoftware.com/). I am also curious to see if the reader is an optical one or a silicon one. I would really like them to provide us with the SDK based on BAPI so that I can develop a new version of the Windows login i developed in the past.
