I finally installed Longhorn and was looking around what was new and found a new service called <B>"<I>Biometric Ressource Manager</I>"</B>. What a surprise for me, they finally decided to do something on that direction. Nice!!! I worked on that subject in my last company and dealed with algorithms but also with Windows login replacement (ah gina!!! I had so much fun with you), embedded system, Web authentication... I will for sure follow this story. Is there any publication on that topic?
