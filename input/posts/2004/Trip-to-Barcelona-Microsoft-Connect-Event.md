Today I am flying to Barcelona - Spain and leaving the horrible weather here in Zürich - Switzerland (same at home in Mulhouse - France). I am attending Microsoft Connect Event, and really hope to see a bit of blue sky there because it has been to much time without sun here.

*Zürich, horrible weather, 8 degrees, raining, but a Ferrari*
