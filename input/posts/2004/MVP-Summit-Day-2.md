I decided to stop to blog on that event as I can't really tell what we see here. But I will stil continue to post about some cool private events, and in that matter i would like to take some words from [RÃ©do](http://blog.developpeur.org/redo): ".Net c'est que du bonheur !!!". Thats a private joke and the concerned guys will understand it for sure ;-)
