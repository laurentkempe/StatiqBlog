Now DNS are updated and I have Exchange 2003 working. I get a new email that I will have to share with my contacts. Thats will be lots of work. There is still something I need to fix: Outlook Web Access

I also installed [Open Relay Filter Enterprise Edition](http://www.vamsoft.com/orf/orfee_prodspec.asp) from [Vamsoft](http://www.vamsoft.com/default.asp). Thanks to them for gracefully providing me a version.
