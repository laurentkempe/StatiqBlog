Yesterday, my friend [Ed Daniel](http://weblogs.asp.net/edaniel/), forwarded me a link to this article: [The Great .NET Identity Crisis](http://www.vbug.co.uk/articles/information/20040521-DotNetIdentityCrisis.asp)Â from [Graham Parker](http://www.learn247.net/werock247/theband/graham_parker.htm).<br><br>I have to say that really liked the article (this is why I blog about it), but I would have replaced "The role of the developer today is about adding value to the business" by "The role of the developer <strike>today</strike> is about adding value to the business". It was always the case.
