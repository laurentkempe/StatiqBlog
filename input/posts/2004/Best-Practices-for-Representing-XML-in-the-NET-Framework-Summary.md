Thats a summary of the [articleÂ from Dare Obasanjo on MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/xml/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnexxml/html/xml03172004.asp). 
<h4>Classes with Fields or Properties that Hold XML</h4>If a class has a field or property that is an XML document or fragment, it should provide mechanisms for manipulating the property as both a string and as an <b>XmlReader</b>. 
<h4>Methods that Accept XML Input or Return XML as Output</h4>Methods that accept or return XML should favor returning <b>XmlReader</b> or <b>XPathNavigator</b> unless the user is expected to be able to edit the XML data, in which case <b>XmlDocument</b> should be used. 
<h4>Converting an Object to XML</h4>If an object wants to provide an XML representation of itself for serialization purposes, then it should use the <b>XmlWriter</b> if it needs more control of the XML serialization process than is provided by the <b>XmlSerializer</b>. If the object wants to provide an XML representation of itself that enables it to participate fully as a member of the XML world, such as allow XPath queries or XSLT transformations over the object, then it should implement the <b>IXPathNavigable</b> interface.
