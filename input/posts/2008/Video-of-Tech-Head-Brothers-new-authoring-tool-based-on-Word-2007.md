In the following video I present the different features of the new authoring tool for my portal [Tech Head Brothers](http://www.techheadbrothers.com/). 

First you will see the use of [ClickOnce](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/t71a733d(VS.80).aspx) to enable easy installation on the author computer. This will also allow an easy update scenario. A great plus compared to the past.

Then you will see the Word 2007 template using to author the content of an article. It shows:

1.  Definition of the **Title**
2.  Definition of the **Description**
3.  Definition of the **Keywords**
4.  Writing of the content of a section of content with **bold, italic, list, hyperlink**
5.  Adding some **sample code **directly copied from Visual Studio 2008
6.  Inserting **sample code in a zip**
7.  Adding a **picture **captured using SnagIt yo the article
8.  **Offline preview **in Internet Explorer
9.  **Posting **to the Tech Head Brothers web site with **Tags **selection
10.  **Online preview **of the posted content
