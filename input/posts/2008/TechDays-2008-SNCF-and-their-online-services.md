I decided to take the TGV train from Mulhouse to Paris to attend the [Tech Days 2008](http://www.microsoft.com/france/mstechdays/default.aspx?e=commdevtechead).

I made my reservation online using SNCF web site, reservation went well and I got per snail mail my way to Paris tickets. Today I wanted to print the way back, that's a special offer in which you have to print your own tickets, now the problems started!
<!-- more -->

First of all my name is Kempé and it seems that they forgot to handle name with accent, such a mistake for a french business web site, I can't believe that! So my name from one page to the other was exchanged from Kempé to "KempÃ©". Then, for sure, the system couldn't find my file. Replacing to the correct name made it and I saw my reservation and could click on print. Good. **NO!!!** The next page was:

> #### Error 500--Internal Server Error
> 
> ##### From RFC 2068 *Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1*:
> 
> ###### 10.5.1 500 Internal Server Error
> 
> The server encountered an unexpected condition which prevented it from fulfilling the request.

So I still have no ticket, that I paid for, to get back home :-(

<u>Update</u>: I finally got my back ticket! I lost 1H30 to get both tickets, next time I will think again about online reservation!
