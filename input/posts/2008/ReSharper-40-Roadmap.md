JetBrains just published a [Roadmap for ReSharper 4.0](http://www.jetbrains.net/confluence/display/ReSharper/ReSharper+4.0+Roadmap) with a soon to come Early Access Program (I can't wait anymore :)

> ReSharper 4.0 is the next major version of the product featuring a number of important enhancements:
<!-- more -->
> 
> *   Support for both Visual Studio 2005 and 2008  Comprehensive support for C# 3.0 language features, including:
> 
>     *   New code analysis, context actions and quick-fixes  New refactorings (such as Convert to Extension Method, Convert to Automatic Property, Convert Anonymous Type to Named)  Updated IntelliSense  Many more intelligence and productivity features
> 
>     *   Full set of refactorings available for VB.NET  New quickfixes and context actions for XAML files  Referenced assemblies are now taken into account in null-reference analysis thanks to external annotations. ReSharper is packaged with annotations for the .NET Framework assemblies  Code Cleanup — a tool for ensuring compliance with code guidelines and enhancing code structure  Complete Statement — a feature that will complete language constructs and get you ready to write the next statement  Many other enhancements and new features throughout the product
> 
> We are really close to opening Early Access Program for the product which is scheduled for January, 2008. Version release is set to happen early in year 2008.

The only thing that I am missing in that tool is a code coverage tool.
