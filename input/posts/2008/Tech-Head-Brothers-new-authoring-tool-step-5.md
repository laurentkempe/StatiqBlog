Tonight my goal was to be able to view a picture into the web browser!

It is really cool to be able to copy a picture into Word, click on preview and see it in the HTML rendered out of my XML coming from WordML. So cool.

So the next steps will be: 

1.  <strike>Projection of hyperlink</strike>  <strike>Projection of picture</strike>  Projection of numbered list and bullet list  Giving the possibility to insert source code  Projection of the source code  Adding the possibility to the author to post the article directly from Word to [Tech Head Brothers](http://www.techheadbrothers.com/) web site using secured web services made out of WCF
