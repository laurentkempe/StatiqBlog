> ##### New Features
> 
> *   **Quick Diff**
> 
> Reviewing changes has never been so easy. Now you don't have to open separate diff window and remember locations of edited code blocks. VisualSVN marks in real-time the text lines changed since original version of the file and offers convenient navigation between them.
> Instead of pressing Page Up/Page Down several times and looking for changes just press Ctrl+Shift+Up/Down and jump to the next change immediatelly.
> 
> *   **Toolbar**
> 
> You don't need to remember curent code branch you are working on. There is current repository URL displayed on the VisualSVN toolbar and you can easily switch to another code branch from there. Buttons for the most common Subversion commands also make the life a bit easier.
> 
> *   **Add Solution Wizard**
> 
> First steps in using VisualSVN might have been non-trivial if you are not a Subversion expert. But with the brand new "Add Solution to Subversion" wizard it's just a piece of cake. The wizard automatically detects all potential problems and makes everything simple and intuitive.
> 
> *   **Improvements and Bugfixes**
> 
> This release contains many stability fixes and improvements (eg. command-line tools included by default, digitally signed istallation package and more). For full list of changes please read [VisualSVN changelog](http://www.visualsvn.com/changelog.html#v1.4).
> 
> #### Upgrading from VisualSVN 1.3.x
> 
> The upgrade to VisualSVN 1.4 is free for all licensed users of VisualSVN. No need to uninstall previous version - simple install new one on top of it.
> 
> #### Download
