<font color="#0080ff">![](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3039/2629237282_b1bae653e6_o.jpg)</font>At [Innoveo Solutions](http://www.innoveo.com/), today we went live with our new corporate identity and announced our product name, [**INNOVEO SKYE**](http://www.innoveo.com/Products.aspx).

I was quite involved into the process with the development of the [web site](http://www.innoveo.com/) and some minor other things.
<!-- more -->

Why a change after only 9 months?      
Simply to reflect our personality, culture, spirit and soul in a more appropriate way:

<font color="#0080ff">VALUES /</font> 

*   INNOVATION 
*   QUALITY, PROFESSIONALISM AND TRANSPARENCY 
*   TRUST AND RESPECT 
*   DYNAMISM AND FUN   

<font color="#0080ff">MISSION /</font>

*   ENABLING BUSINESS INNOVATION   

<font color="#0080ff">VISION /</font>

*   BE RESPECTED LEADERS IN CONNECTING THE INSURANCE BUSINESS WITH TECHNOLOGY   

We started with an internal launch (I hope to be able to post some videos about it soon) made by Nick and myself!

Then after the official launch we had a little party with some German specialities brought by our German guy, Oli! And some from Italy brought by Nick!

And we made a little tour of the building to look at the new logo everywhere!
