After some cleanup on my C: drive to get back to the 7Gb minimum free space needed, an update to the latest drivers of ATI and finally a backup with [Acronis](http://www.acronis.com/) True Image Workstation, I was ready to install the Windows Vista SP1.

The installation took a bit more than 1h and was successful!

<u>Update</u>: Take care it really **needs 7Gb on the C: drive to install**!
