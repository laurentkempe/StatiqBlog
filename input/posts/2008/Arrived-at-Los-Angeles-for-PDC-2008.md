We finally arrived in Los Angeles, [Sébastien Ros](http://www.dotnetguru2.org/sebastienros/) and myself after quite a trip.

We left Mulhouse (East of France) at 7:AM on Saturday direction Paris, then Paris direction Seattle and finally Los Angeles.

We had a Mexican diner, I love Mexican food, with Sébastien at [Loteria Grill – Hollywood](http://www.loteriagrill.com/loteriahollywood). There website sucks but the place is good and the food was excellent.

We were 25 hours up and running and I am somehow tired. The first night at The hotel Roosevelet on Hollywood Boulevard was awful with two neighbors rooms making such a noise from 11PM to 2 AM finished by a big fight in the hotel corridor on the 8th floor. Unbelievable!!!

I couldn’t make any picture during the flight from Paris to Seattle, but we saw some amazing scene on top of Iceland and Canada!

Here a re some pictures of the trip from Seattle to Los Angeles with Alaska Airlines!
