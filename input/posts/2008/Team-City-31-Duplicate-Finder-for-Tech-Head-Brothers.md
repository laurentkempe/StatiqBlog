For the development of the next version of [Tech Head Brothers](http://www.techheadbrothers.com/) I wanted to have a continuous integration server running for our small team. I used for that [Team City 3](http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity) from [JetBrains](http://www.jetbrains.com/). 

Continuous integration is very nice and works very good. Then I discovered another nice feature directly built in Team City: [Duplicate Finder](http://www.jetbrains.net/confluence/display/TCD3/Duplicates+Finder+%28.NET%29). Ok you might use other tools to do that, but it is there so just use it in two clicks.

As the name tells it, the aim is to find duplicates of code in your solution.

We use it daily as a kind of "nightly build" to get a morning email about the possible code smell in our code.

And this is the way it shows up the duplicates found.

I can see here that in VideoUrlRewrite and ArticleUrlRewrite classes I have so work to do :-)

Isn't that nice?
