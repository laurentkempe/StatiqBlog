It supports C# 3.0 and LINQ, plugs nicely into Visual Studio 2008 and 2005 and also support VB.NET.

It includes:

*   **Full Support for C# 3.0 and LINQ**; Full Edition and C# Edition provide comprehensive support for C# 3.0, including LINQ, implicitly typed locals and arrays, extension methods, automatic properties, lambda expressions, object & collection initializers, anonymous types, expression trees, and partial methods

*   **Solution-Wide Analysis**, which looks for erroneous C# code in your whole solution on-the-fly, without compiling it first 
*   **Code Cleanup**, flexible code compliance and formatting tool bringing together a dozen of ReSharper features. In addition to fine-tuning formatting style to use, you can opt to arrange 'this' qualifier, remove code redundancies, convert properties with backup fields to auto-properties, make fields read-only if possible, optimize using directives, shorten qualified references, update file header, replace explicit types with vars, and revamp your C# code with many more settings

    *   *CamelHumps in Code Completion*, allowing you to complete any symbol by entering only its uppercase characters. 
    *   *Live Templates Editor & Manager*, rejuvenated set of user interface items for viewing, managing, and editing all three types of templates — Live Templates, Surround With Templates, and File Templates. 
    *   *Recent Edits*, drop-down list similar to existing Go To features that shows files and symbols that you recently modified.
