First if you are using **Silverlight 2 Beta 1**, you will be [able to upload your video with pause and resume](http://dev.live.com/blogs/sls/archive/2008/05/30/317.aspx). Second they finally deliver a [HTTP endpoint for videos hosted in Silverlight Streaming](http://dev.live.com/blogs/sls/archive/2008/05/30/316.aspx).

We will make with Mathieu a great use of those two features soon :-)
