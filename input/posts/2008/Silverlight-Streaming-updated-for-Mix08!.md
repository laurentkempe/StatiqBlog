First of all it goes from 4Gb to 10Gb, **whouah**!

<!-- more -->

You can manage Video directly from the administration interface now!

> Specify the video to upload using the **Browse** button, then type in a name and click on **Upload**. The video file must be **smaller than 105 MB**. This is equivalent to 10 minutes of video playback at a bit rate of 1.4 Mbps. Please wait as the upload may take a few minutes

And more

> [Silverlight™ Streaming by Windows Live](http://silverlight.live.com/) is the companion service to [Silverlight](http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight). We are increasing the free hosting and storage limit to 10 GB and can now stream HQ content at 1400Kbps ([see a sample here](http://silverlight.services.live.com/invoke/6579/HDCORAL1400KBPS/iframe.html)). During the SLS alpha we saw most scenarios were media driven (i.e. video/audio) – to make it easier for content producers to get their media in front of their users, we have introduced a Video Management scenario which allows media to be uploaded in many formats (Flash, DIVX, MPEG-4, QuickTime, H.264, H.263, WMV1, WMV2, MPEG-1, MPEG-2) and we will transcode the content into a Silverlight™ compatible WMV/VC-1 format. For developers we have introduced a new WebDAV API for Silverlight Streaming which allows for file by file management and Web Folders support - for more information [go here](http://dev.live.com/silverlight/). *
