[JetBrains](http://www.jetbrains.com/) just released a [First Candidate release of ReSharper 4.0 marked as Stable](http://www.jetbrains.net/confluence/display/ReSharper/ReSharper+4.0+Nightly+Builds)!

<!-- more -->

You might read more about this version 4.0 on the [ReSharper 4.0 EAP Notes](http://www.jetbrains.net/confluence/display/ReSharper/ReSharper+4.0+EAP+Notes)

I am using the 4.0 EAP for quite some time and I am really happy with it! In fact I just can't work without ReSharper!
