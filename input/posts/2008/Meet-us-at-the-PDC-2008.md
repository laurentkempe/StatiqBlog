[![](http://www.microsoftpdc.com/Images/BlogBling/Bling2.jpg)](http://www.microsoftpdc.com/Default.aspx) This year I will finally attend the Professional Developers Conference (PDC) from October 27 to October 30 in Los Angeles.

I really look forward to see where will head [Live Mesh](http://www.mesh.com/). Some year’s ago I was impressed (and I am not that often impressed) by an application called [Groove](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/groove/FX100487641033.aspx). [Groove](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/groove/FX100487641033.aspx) is an application, but less known is that it is also a platform on top of which you could develop! It was already an initiative of [Ray Ozzie](http://microsoftpdc.com/Agenda/Speakers.aspx#RayOzzie). At that time I enjoyed seeing a Windows application exposing Web Services on your local machine to program against, nice idea. With [Live Mesh](http://www.mesh.com/) it is a clear next step. And now thanks to [Silverlight](http://msdn.microsoft.com/silverlight) your applications can be hosted on your notebook but also on the cloud, so there will be accessible from any device with Internet access. I already have an idea for one application to explore this new architecture.

I look forward to learn more about Cloud Services, [Velocity](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/cc655792.aspx), Oslo, Parallelism, the new version of Workflow… It will be an intensive week!

I hope to see the launch of [Silverlight](http://msdn.microsoft.com/silverlight) for mobile device, the Live Mesh client for mobile device! And why not a synchronization extension for [Zune](http://www.zune.net/) using Live Mesh (this would be hot !) 

If I find the time to finalize my project before October 17, I will also try to participate to the [Show Off contest](http://www.microsoftpdc.com/Social/Contest/ShowOff.aspx)!

I think we might have also a good time at the [Tuesday evening party in Universal Studios Hollywood](http://www.microsoftpdc.com/Social/AttendeeParty.aspx)!

And as I am a fan of Mexican food the last post on [the PDC blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/pdc/archive/tags/Social/default.aspx) was really good for me! [L.A. Insights: Mexican Food](http://www.microsoftpdc.com/View.aspx?post=91d46819-8472-40ad-a661-2c78acb4018c:8926962&tag=Social), I hope to have some time to experience some of those different places!
