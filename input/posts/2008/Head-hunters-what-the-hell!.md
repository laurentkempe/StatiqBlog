Those last week I got 4 emails and a contact through messenger from 3 different head hunters of the same company! They are really **aggressively** searching for .NET and Sharepoint peoples.

I got the last email end of this afternoon asking me if I was interested (to which I answered again that it wasn't the case) then asking me if on my [Tech Head Brothers](http://www.techheadbrothers.com/) web site it was possible to publish a ad about their job offer. They even not wait any answer and decided to publish their ad as comments on the site.

**I fill really sad **that people making money like that have no respect to the work done by volunteers on community web sites.

Please give us a bit of respect toward the tremendous amount of free hours spent on the volunteers community, thanks.
