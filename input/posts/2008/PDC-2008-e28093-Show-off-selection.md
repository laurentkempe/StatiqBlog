Finally my video didn’t make it for the ShowOff contest at the PDC 2008. Here is the answer I’ve got:

Unfortunately, due to the overwhelming response to ShowOff, we had to make some hard decisions about which entries we would be able to show during the event. We really liked your video, but unfortunately it didn't make it into our final cut this year.

So here the video I sent in which I demonstrate some of the possibilities of the [Tech Head Brothers](http://www.techheadbrothers.com/) authoring tool based on Word 2007 and Open XML!
