This is something I was waiting to continue my work on the new publishing tool for [Tech Head Brothers](http://www.techheadbrothers.com/). 

You might read more about this version [on the MSDN web page](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb448854.aspx)
<!-- more -->

> This SDK is built on top of the **System.IO.Packaging** API and provides strongly-typed part classes to manipulate Open XML documents.

You can [download this CTP on the following page](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=AD0B72FB-4A1D-4C52-BDB5-7DD7E816D046&displaylang=en).
