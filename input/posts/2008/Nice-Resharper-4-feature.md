Today I am developing for my company [innoveo solutions](http://www.innoveo.com), and hope to be able to tell you on what soon ;-)

I came accross this great new feature of JetBrains ReSharper 4, [read more about all features on this page](http://www.jetbrains.net/confluence/display/ReSharper/ReSharper+4.0+EAP+Notes).

I used there:

*   Object and collection initializers
*   Implicitly typed locals and arrays
*   Code Cleanup 

I will soon have to tell more about the usage of JetBrains [Team City](http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/) by [innoveo solutions](http://www.innoveo.com) and personally!
