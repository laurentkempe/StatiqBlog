My friend [David Catuhe](http://www.techheadbrothers.com/Auteurs.aspx/david-catuhe) ([his French blog](http://catuhe.devx.fr/)) just released a demo of what he calls a **little 3D engine** in Silverlight 2.

This guy is not only a great person but also a high technically qualified engineer. And I even don't talk about his speaker talent.

Truly awesome what you have done David!
