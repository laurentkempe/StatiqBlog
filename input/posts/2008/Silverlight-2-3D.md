My friend [David Catuhe](http://www.techheadbrothers.com/Auteurs.aspx/david-catuhe) ([his French blog](http://catuhe.devx.fr/)) just released a demo of what he calls a **little 3D engine** in Silverlight 2.

Check it out here: [http://www.vertice.fr/NovaLight/NovaLightTestPage.html](http://www.vertice.fr/NovaLight/NovaLightTestPage.html)

This guy is not only a great person but also a high technically qualified engineer. And I even don't talk about his speaker talent.

Truly awesome what you have done David!

You might also check Nova, the real time 3D engine he made, for his company [Vertice](http://www.vertice.fr/index.htm).
