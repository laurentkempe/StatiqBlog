Tonight I found a little tip that you might already know but for me it was the first time I realize that.

When you want to open the properties of a project in Visual Studio 2008, in the past I was doing a right click on the project then I was searching for couple of seconds the entry properties
<!-- more -->

And since today I do it slightly differently I expand the project and double click on the Properties folder which open the Properties of the project, obvious (at least when you know it ;)
