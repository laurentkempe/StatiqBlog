Beginning of October we announced, through [Mark’s blog](http://markkemper1.blogspot.com/),  the update of the two open source projects we have at [Jobping](http://www.jobping.com/) 

*   ##### [Jobping Url Shortener version 0.6](http://markkemper1.blogspot.com/2010/10/jobping-url-shortener-version-06.html)
<!-- more -->

*   ##### [StickyBeak version 0.3](http://markkemper1.blogspot.com/2010/10/stickybeak-version-03-released.html)

##### 

We also would like to share the way we streamlined our build process to have something very useful where you just need to click on a button to have your full build running. By the way we use exactly the same technics to be able to deploy [Jobping](http://www.jobping.com/)to our different stages, one click on a button in TeamCity!

So I encourage you to read the Build series which Mark started!

*   *   [Create a Build File for a Visual Studio Solution - MsBuild Series](http://markkemper1.blogspot.com/2010/10/create-build-file-for-visual-studio.html) 
    *   [Mercurial Revision No to Version your AssemblyInfo - MsBuild Series](http://markkemper1.blogspot.com/2010/10/mercurial-revision-no-to-version-your.html) 
    *   [Zipping Build Outputs - MsBuild Series (this post)](http://markkemper1.blogspot.com/2010/10/zipping-build-outputs-using-build-file.html)
    *   NuPack packaging - MsBuild Series (coming soon) 
    *   NUnit Testing - MsBuild Series (coming later) 
    *   Web Projects and AspNetComplier - MsBuild Series (coming later) 
    *   Cruise Control - MsBuild Series (coming later)
