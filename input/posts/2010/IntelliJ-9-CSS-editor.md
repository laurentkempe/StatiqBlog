Today at [Innoveo Solutions](http://www.innoveo.com/)  I work on [CSS](http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/) and [XHTML](http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/) for our Skye® product.

I am using [JetBrains](http://www.jetbrains.com/)  [IntelliJ 9](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/index.html) since a couple of weeks now and I enjoy it very much.

I am always searching for tools which make me more productive in my daily work. [IntelliJ 9](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/index.html) is such a tool. And today I have used a feature that helped me a lot.

I started with a CSS I received with that definition 

![4581559488_dbe2f66d3d_o[1]](/images/4581559488_dbe2f66d3d_o%5B1%5D.png "4581559488_dbe2f66d3d_o[1]") 

If you take care you will see the underline under margin and background, when you place the cursor over you get the following info

![4580933991_875d77222b_o[1]](/images/4580933991_875d77222b_o%5B1%5D.png "4580933991_875d77222b_o[1]") 

Then you can press ALT-Enter to get an action that you can execute; “optimize margin properties”

![4580947043_53b7dd6c0d_o[1]](/images/4580947043_53b7dd6c0d_o%5B1%5D.png "4580947043_53b7dd6c0d_o[1]") 

So when you execute the action for margin and background you get the following optimized result

![4581578768_3002940edb_o[1]](/images/4581578768_3002940edb_o%5B1%5D.png "4581578768_3002940edb_o[1]") 

You might read more about the CSS capabilities of [JetBrains IntelliJ 9 on the following blog](http://blogs.jetbrains.com/idea/tag/css/).
