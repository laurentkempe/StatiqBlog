[Patrick](http://codebetter.com/blogs/patricksmacchia/) just announced on his blog the launch of the new [NDepend v3](http://www.ndepend.com/Version3BetaProgram.aspx). It is still in beta but very stable. I am testing it for a month now and enjoy very much it’s integration in Visual Studio 2008. I was using it and will continue to use it in our continuous integration server, [TeamCity](http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/index.html). But getting feedback right out of the developer environment is a very interesting feature.
