[Press Release](http://blog.jobping.com/2010/04/jobping-launches-niche-job-website.html)

> *Sydney, Australia - April 22, 2010** - **Last week, Jobping, a new job posting web site aimed specifically at job seekers and employers who work with Microsoft technologies, was released into public beta.*
<!-- more -->
> 
> Jobping currently focuses on the Australian market and aims to bring a better quality of candidate to a posted vacancy via a niche, industry targeted approach.
> 
> The site is unique, user friendly and streamlined when compared to the larger job post boards. For instance, publishing is done in a couple of clicks and the job is instantly broadcast through [Twitter](http://twitter.com/jobping), [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Jobping/301717272403) and job indexing sites such as Indeed and CareerJet. Recruiters are also able to add their company Twitter feed to a job post in order to cross sell other vacancies all in one place.
> 
> From a job seeker point of view Jobping searching works just like today's search engines with specific job filtering options. Job seekers also benefit by being kept up to date in a variety of ways including through Rss, Internet Explorer Web Slice, Twitter or Facebook. Similarly, job seekers are able to apply for a position using their LinkedIn profile, saving time and eliminating the need to keep two separate resumes up to date and they may optionally attach a traditional pdf or word resume.
> 
> More features and functions based on user feedback and requirements will be implemented quickly as Jobping takes an organic and user oriented approach to product development.
> 
> Jobping will remain free during the beta period which will continue for 3-6 months. Advertisers utilising the site during the beta period will be rewarded through special discounts once the pricing structure is introduced.
