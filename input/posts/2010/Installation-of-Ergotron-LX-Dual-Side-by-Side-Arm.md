I am reworking my home office and it was time to start with my work place ergonomic.

One of my goal was to cleanup a bit and gain some place on my desk. I wanted to be able to move my two 24’’ Samsung SyncMaster 2493HM monitors so that I can work on paper without going to another desk. I also wanted to be able adjust the position of the monitor easily.

Searching for a solution I found the [LX Dual Side-by-Side Arm](http://www.ergotron.com/Products/tabid/65/PRDID/354/language/en-US/Default.aspx) from [Ergotron](http://www.ergotron.com/).

Here is the front of my desk, before the change

And here the back of my desk before the change

The [LX Dual Side-by-Side Arm](http://www.ergotron.com/Products/tabid/65/PRDID/354/language/en-US/Default.aspx) in there very good packaging

I also got [Ergotron VESA Bracket Adaptor Kit](http://www.ergotron.com/Products/tabid/65/PRDID/253/Language/en-US/Default.aspx) to be able to adapt the VESA bracket of my monitors to the arms.

First step was to dismount the monitor from the now obsolete feet

Then mounting the [Ergotron VESA Bracket Adaptor Kit](http://www.ergotron.com/Products/tabid/65/PRDID/253/Language/en-US/Default.aspx) was super easy !

Finally attaching the [LX Dual Side-by-Side Arm](http://www.ergotron.com/Products/tabid/65/PRDID/354/language/en-US/Default.aspx) to the VESA Bracket Adaptor.
 First result without tuning the arms !

And the final result

It took only 1 hour to set the two arms and it was quite easy.

<font style="background-color: #ffffff">What I liked during the mounting:</font>

*   Very easy to do
*   Fast
*   Provided cables guide, covers…  

What I disliked during the mounting:

*   Nothing, no seriously nothing!  

All in all a very good experience mounting it, I will soon also post about the experience using the arms, give me some usage time, stay tuned.

You might have a look to [other pictures on my flickr account](http://www.flickr.com/photos/laurentkempe/sets/72157624611507137/).

Now I also need to change my keyboard to a wireless one!
