Yesterday I got the new issue of MSDN Magazine in my mailbox and as often I started to go quickly around it to get an overview of what kind of subject’s it talks about. And as often I end up at the last page’s article which is the first I am reading.

This time [David S. Platt](http://msdn.microsoft.com/ee532098.aspx?sdmr=DavidPlatt&sdmi=authors) is writing about “[Fundamental Laws](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ff646970.aspx)” which start like that

> Whenever I find a program or Web site that sucks, it’s invariably because the developer or designer **forgot the user’s goals **and started embellishing the program for its own sake.

This reminded me a discussion I had a year and a half ago at Christmas time when [my brother](http://myaustraliantrip.blogspot.com/) was back from Australia. We were discussing about what became [Jobping](http://www.jobping.com).

And as you can read fom Jobping  press release, “[Jobping launches niche job website listing Microsoft skilled vacancies](http://blog.jobping.com/2010/04/jobping-launches-niche-job-website.html)”, it is one of our priority:

> More features and functions based **on user feedback and requirements **will be implemented quickly as Jobping takes an organic and user oriented approach to product development.

From David

> Your software has zero value in and of itself. Nothing. Nada. Zero point zero zero. The only value it ever has or ever will have is the degree to which it **enhances the happiness of your user in some way**

So when you develop software you’d better understand and listen to the problem of your users to delight them and enhance their happiness.
