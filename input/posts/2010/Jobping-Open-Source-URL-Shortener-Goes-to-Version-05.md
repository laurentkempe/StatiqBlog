We have updated our url shortener for[ Jobping](http://www.jobping.com/). [jobp.in](http://jobp.in/) has moved along to Version 0.5. While maintaining as little features as possible!

Since the initial version we have placed a restriction(web.configurable) on the domain names that the shortener will shorten. We did this so only domains under jobping.com would be processed by the shortener. We wanted to maintain the integrity of the jobp.in domain. With this in place you can be sure that if you click a link shortened by [http://jobp.in](http://jobp.in/)Â  it will always go to our site [www.jobping.com](http://www.jobping.com) site.
<!-- more -->

This version also includes a new custom style, which looks awesome and is now slick and styled inline with our main site [Jobping](http://www.jobping.com/).
