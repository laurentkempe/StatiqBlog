In September 2009 I posted about a tool I am using to build my MSBuild projects from the shell “[Build your .NET project with a right click in Windows Explorer](http://www.laurentkempe.com/post/Build-your-NET-project-with-a-right-click-in-Windows-Explorer.aspx)”

Last week I changed to [MSBuild Launch Pad (mPad)](http://msbuildlaunchpad.codeplex.com/) which also add a context menu when you right click your project or solution files.
<!-- more -->

The added value for me is that it maintained project, 1.0 was released on May 21, 2010 with following release notes:

*   *   Support sln, csproj, vbproj, vcxproj, shfbproj, ccproj, oxygene and proj files execution.
    *   Basic settings such as Show Prompt, and Auto Hide are provided. 
    *   MSBuild Shell Extension integration is achieved.   

I also very much like that when I right click and say build I get the control on the .NET framework version I want to use and if it is a Release, Debug or what so ever.

Nice little productivity booster tool.
