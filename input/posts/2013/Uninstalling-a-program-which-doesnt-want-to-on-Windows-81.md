I updated to Windows 8.1 RTM a week ago and since that time I had the issue that AMD Radeon™ RAMDisk was not running but even worse I could not uninstall it because the uninstaller was saying that it was the wrong version of the operating system!   
I was using it on Windows 8, it was working great on it but after the update it wasn’t anymore.

The solution I found is to use [**Microsoft Fix It – “Fix problems with programs that can't be installed or uninstalled”**](http://support.microsoft.com/mats/program_install_and_uninstall/). I followed the wizard, could pick up that I had an uninstall issue then I could choose which software was in trouble and finally could uninstall it!

Great tool! Thanks **Microsoft Fix it!**
