I don't get it!!! I thought that pageflow will be soon integrated into ASP.NET directly! When will it be and in which form ?

> It turned out that the code we showed at TechEd wasn't going to end up in any of the product releases, so the dev team requested permission to release that code as a sample of how one can implement a generic navigation framework using WF that can support multiple UI technologies (i.e. ASP.NET and WPF).
