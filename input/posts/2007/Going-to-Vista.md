After several issues using Windows XP with ATI Drivers I decided to update to Vista my new professional notebook, a great [HP nw 8440 with 4Gb memory](http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/us/en/sm/WF06a/321957-321957-64295-321838-3329741-1839152.html) :-). The update went as I thought, I was not able to reboot on Vista, after trying to fix it till 2AM with the tools on Vista DVD, it was without any luck and as I am not a real fan about updating OS, I decided to do a full install of Vista. So my dear friends of [ecenter solutions](http://www.ecenter-solutions.com/), or what ever ;-), you will have to try yourself the update or to do another full installation. I see your face Bojan ;-)

To restore needed files from the old notebook installation I used [Acronis True Image Workstation](http://www.acronis.com/enterprise/products/ATICW/) (offered by Acronis, Thanks). And I have to say that I really liked the way to mount an image and browse the file as read only. A great tool.

The installation and patches went really well and now I am almost ready to go and it is great to see that all my issues with changing the screen resolution went away, even with my docking station. Great. Still needing the Cisco VPN tool for Vista; but it zill qrrive I hope soon:

Btw I had an issue to install a tool I can't leave without: [GhostDoc](http://www.roland-weigelt.de/ghostdoc/) and found [the solution on the forum](http://ghostdoc.12.forumer.com/viewtopic.php?t=166)  

*   *   Create a batch file in the directory where the MSI file resides, containing the following line:   
msiexec /i GhostDoc1.9.5.msi  Right-click on the batch file and select "Run as Administrator"
