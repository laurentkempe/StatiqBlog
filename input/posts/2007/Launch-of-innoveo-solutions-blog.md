A few seconds ago [Didier](http://www.didierbeck.com/) and I just launched [innoveo solutions blog](http://blog.innoveo.com/home.aspx).

If you ask yourself what is [innoveo solutions](http://www.innoveo.com/), it is my new company and you might read more about it here:

[Today was my last day at ecenter solutions (Helvetia)](http://weblogs.asp.net/lkempe/archive/2007/09/28/today-was-my-last-day-at-ecenter-solutions-helvetia.aspx "Today was my last day at ecenter solutions (Helvetia)")

I am delighted about this announce because I had the pleasure to develop it with my colleague Roy, a very nice experience that will go on. We used [Scrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(development)) project management methodology and with some experience now I have to say that I am really convince about it.

In the future I will for sure continue to post [on my own blog](http://weblogs.asp.net/lkempe/) but will cross-post some of my posts on [innoveo blog](http://blog.innoveo.com/home.aspx).
