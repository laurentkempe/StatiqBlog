The guys that already made [VisualSVN](http://www.visualsvn.com/), a plugin that integrates into Visual Studio and provides a way to manage your source code changes into [Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/), just realized [VisualSVN Server](http://www.visualsvn.com/server/). 

> VisualSVN Server is a package that contains everything you need to install, configure and manage **Subversion server** for your team on **Windows platform.** It includes Subversion, Apache and a management console.
