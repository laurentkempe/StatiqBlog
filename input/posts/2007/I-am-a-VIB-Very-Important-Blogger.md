Nice :-) !!! First I was MVP now I am also VIB.

Two weeks ago I got an email from Microsoft to invite me to the Mix in Paris. This email was starting with the following "**[Invitation presse/VIB]**", I had absolutely no clue what VIB was for, and as I was not someone from the press, I supposed I was a VIB. Unfortunately I couldn't attend the Mix 2007 in Paris.

Today I got the answer from [LeMondeInformatique.fr](http://www.lemondeinformatique.fr/actualites/lire-mix-07-paris-microsoft-montre-silverlight-aux-influenceurs-francais-23232.html), VIB = Very Important Blogger.
