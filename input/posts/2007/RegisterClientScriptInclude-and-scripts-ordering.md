I spend a part of this evening fighting with *ScriptManager.RegisterClientScriptInclude* and had no chance to use it in a way that my javascripts would appear after MicrosoftAjax.js and in an order that I defined.

I finally found a solution, using ScriptManagerProxy and declaratively listing the javascripts in the order I wanted.
