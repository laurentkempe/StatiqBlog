If you are an Adsense user you can't miss that free tool from [my friend Nix](http://blogs.codes-sources.com/nix/).

[**CSV AdStats**](http://www.nix.fr/csvadstats.aspx) let you analyze your Adsense statistics on a detail level not even offered by Google on his site.
<!-- more -->

With this new version you can display multiple layered graphics to analyze the progression on different values. You can compare year by year... lots of features.

After a late night troubleshooting with me yesterday, Nix went online with this version. **Great Job Nix!**
