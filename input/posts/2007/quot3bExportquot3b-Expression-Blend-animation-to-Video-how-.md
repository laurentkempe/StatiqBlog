I have made an animation using [Microsoft Expression Blend 2](http://www.microsoft.com/expression/products/overview.aspx?key=blend) December Preview that I would like to export to a Video, anyone made that already? How?

I used [Camtasia 5](http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.asp) to record the screen directly from Blend 2. The result is not bad but it miss some fluidity in the video of the animation!

So anybody have another way of doing it? 

Thanks
