I just pushed to production the new version of my French portal [Tech Head Brothers](http://www.techheadbrothers.com/) that uses .NET Framework 3.5.

This new release correct some bugs of the old release and improve some part of the design. For the new functionality you will have to wait for the next release that will include some great new .NET technologies.
<!-- more -->

So today here are the technologies used on the site:

*   .NET Framework 3.5  C# 3.0  ASP.NET  ASP.NET AJAX  ASP.NET AJAX Control Toolkit  WebParts  CSS Friendly Adapter  Windows Communication Foundation  RSS  XML/XSLT, XML Schema 

and the "technologies" that are indirectly used are:

*   Office Word 2007
*   Visual Studio Tools for Office 
*   Windows Live Writer avec son SDK 
*   ClickOnce
