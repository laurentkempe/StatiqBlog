This morning due to a modification error I made in a [ReSharper](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper) [Live Template](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/features/code_templates.html#Live_Templates_full) I discovered a cool feature, see the following picture in which [ReSharper](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper) shows you that you made a recursive call:

<!-- more -->

By the way, [ReSharper Code Templates](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/features/code_templates.html) are really cool, my first usage is to have some [Live Templates](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/features/code_templates.html#Live_Templates_full) to be able to quickly create properties for my business entities used by [Euss](http://euss.evaluant.com/), for example:

will act like the following in Visual Studio, typing e:

then hit tab

To get the final result:

At the end I typed string and Name!! Cool.

I also use it a lot to create nuint tests methods, assert...
