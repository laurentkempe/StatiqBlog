Here is a recommendation made by [Didier Beck](http://www.didierbeck.com/) on my [LinkedIn profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/laurentkempe)

> “I had the chance to hire Laurent and to work with him during 5 years, without managing him directly. Laurent is a very nice person and a highly experienced expert as Senior Solution Architect. Greatly committed, supporting our team-spirit, he was very appreciated inside our company, and outside, by our customers, for his professionalism. Laurent is specially strong in 4 fields: Software Lifecycle Management, complex and scalable Web application Architecture and Technology, SOA implementation, linking efficiently Infrastructure and Software Architectures.” September 27, 2007

I will have a "[New start on next Monday](http://weblogs.asp.net/lkempe/archive/2007/09/25/new-start-on-next-monday.aspx)" at [**innoveo solutions**](http://www.innoveo.com/) also as a Senior Solution Architect.

My role in [**innoveo solutions**](http://www.innoveo.com/) will be:

*   Architecture, conception, design and realization of customer solutions.

So I leave a company to get in a new one, and the great point is that all my former colleagues (except one, you will miss Thomas) will also be my future colleagues at [**innoveo solutions**](http://www.innoveo.com/).
