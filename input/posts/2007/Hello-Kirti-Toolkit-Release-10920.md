> This has been a long awaited release and has lots of important bug fixes. We were unable to get the Test Framework ready in time and hope to get that out later. The release notes talk about it in detail at this [new sample website location](http://asp.net/ajax/ajaxcontroltoolkit/samples). The binaries can be downloaded from the [Toolkit Release page](http://www.codeplex.com/AtlasControlToolkit/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=4941).

> Please try it out and let us know if you run into any issues.
