I just have seen a copy of my last post '[Yahoo release a web site evaluation tool called YSlow](http://weblogs.asp.net/lkempe/archive/2007/08/19/yahoo-release-a-web-site-evaluation-tool-called-yslow.aspx "Yahoo release a web site evaluation tool called YSlow")' on the following web page "[http://clevelandwebsitedesignblog.insightstyle.com/2007/08/yahoo-release-web-site-evaluation-tool.html#links](http://clevelandwebsitedesignblog.insightstyle.com/2007/08/yahoo-release-web-site-evaluation-tool.html#links "http://clevelandwebsitedesignblog.insightstyle.com/2007/08/yahoo-release-web-site-evaluation-tool.html#links")"

No quotes, no link back to the original post just a straight copy. I think it is a disrespect for the author and I hate that.
