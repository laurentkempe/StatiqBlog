I am currently migrating [Tech Head Brothers Authoring tool](http://www.codeplex.com/THBAuthoring) to Visual Studio 2008! And found this cool feature, it is crazy that you use a tool for quite some time (VS05) and always find little trick like that.
<!-- more -->

I found it on Visual Studio 2008 and tested it on Visual Studio 2005 and was surprised to see that it was already there and that I never realized about it.

So you can from Solution Explorer show all files that are on the directory of your project and include those easily.

This makes my life really easier in porting my tool to VS08 and know I hope the ClickOnce for VSTO will work good.
