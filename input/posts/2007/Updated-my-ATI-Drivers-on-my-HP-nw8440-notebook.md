I just updated my drivers from my HP nw8440 using the new tool [DH Mobility Modder.net](http://www.driverheaven.net/modtool/). It runs now the last version of ATI Catalyst Drivers and after some time of usage I must say that I am happy about it.

<u>Note</u>: I had not to disable UAC to run the DH Mobility Modder.net, but I runned it as Administrator.

I used another tool in the past as written in my old post [Notebook and ATI Drivers](http://weblogs.asp.net/lkempe/archive/2006/11/05/Notebook-and-ATI-Drivers.aspx).

So a big thanks to Ruud Ketelaars for his fantastic tool.
