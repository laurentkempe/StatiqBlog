It was a straight move from RC to RTM and I have managed to have it online after deploying it to staging, doing some tests and then deployed it Production, thanks to [Web Deployment Projects](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/asp.net/aa336619.aspx).

Here you can see an ASP.NET 2 Webpart on [Tech Head Brothers](http://www.techheadbrothers.com/) using ASP.NET AJAX 1 to browse all news of the site on the home page:

And my personal tab control (now there is one in the toolkit) using ASP.NET AJAX 1 to display articles, tips, and contact of an author:

<u>Update</u>: btw the RTM solved the issue I had with [ASP.NET Ajax RC and Google Adsense](http://weblogs.asp.net/lkempe/archive/2006/12/22/asp-net-ajax-rc-and-google-adsense.aspx)
