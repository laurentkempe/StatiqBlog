It is announced on the [blog of the team](http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!D85741BB5E0BE8AA!1442.entry).

In the new features we now have access to **spell checker in four languages:**
<!-- more -->

1.  English (US, UK, Canadian)
2.  French
3.  German
4.  Spanish 

**Generic [AtomPub](http://bitworking.org/projects/atom/) Support**, this bring another set of standardized API to the tool. I really look forward to use it.

Now it also install correctly on **Windows Vista x64**.

And finally it makes your life easier if you use or wants to use [**Spaces**](http://home.services.spaces.live.com/).

You might download this new final version with all the other live tools, messenger... [on this page](http://get.live.com/wl/all).

I use extensively Windows Live Writer:

1.  To let authors publish news on [Tech Head Brothers](http://www.techheadbrothers.com/), it uses the blog part of Live Writer. And I am also leveraging the Page possibilities to let authors edit their Bio directly from Live Writer.
2.  At [innoveo solutions](http://www.innoveo.com/), we are using Live Writer to let people publish content easily on the web site. I developed the web site and integrated MetaBlogAPI and Word Press API, letting publisher using live writer to post news and publications but also modifying the content of the pages. 

Btw I still have seen a bug in this release, I am running vista with font DPI set to 110 and the categories are not shown correctly in the list.
