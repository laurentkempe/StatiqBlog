I arrived this morning really early at the conference [Le Web 3 '07](http://www.leweb3.com/leweb3/) with [Didier](http://didierbeck.com/).

As you can see on [Didier's](http://didierbeck.com/) shot there were not that much people in the room:

We will be there till Thursday mid-day, so if anybody wants to meet in Paris, please feel free to contact me.

By the way normally there should be an announcement concerning [innoveo](http://www.innoveo.com/).
