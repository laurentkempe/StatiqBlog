I just got an email from JetBrains with some content about ReSharper 4.0 for Visual Studio 2008, that I am sharing here: 

> ** Comprehensive **support for C# 3.0 language features**, including:
<!-- more -->
> - New code analysis, context actions and quick-fixes
> - New refactorings (such as Convert to Extension Method, Convert to Automatic Property, Convert Anonymous Type to Named)
> - Many more intelligence and productivity features
> ** Full set of refactorings available for [VB.NET](http://VB.NET).
> ** Compiled libraries are now taken into account in null-reference analysis thanks to external annotations. Stardard libraries come with pre-packaged annotations.
> ** Code Cleanup - a tool for ensuring compliance with code guidelines and enhancing code structure.
> ** Complete Statement - a feature that will complete language constructs and get you ready to write the next statement.
> ** Many other enhancements and new features throughout the product.
