[TechSmith](http://www.techsmith.com/)Â just released an [output addin](http://www.techsmith.com/snagit/accessories.asp?catID=1) for [SnagIt](http://www.techsmith.com/screen-capture.asp): [SnagIt Output for Microsoft OneNote 2007](http://www.techsmith.com/snagit/accessories/onenote.asp).

This is a very good combination, because I am using a lot SnagIt to communicate and [OneNote 2007](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/onenote/default.aspx) to keep notes about the founding I make on the internet, now I can easily bring a snapshot to OneNote.
