I was experiencing for some time a quite strange effect on my no so old installation of Windows Vista. After some dyas of usage without any reboot I sometime was unable to open any new window, it could be an explorer, internet explorer 7 tab, a menu of tray icon, and this without any error message. I first thought it was an issue with the video driver, but after too much annoyance I searched the web and found a post "[Max Num. of Open Windows under XP/2003/VISTA - Resolved !](http://weblogs.asp.net/israelio/archive/2007/02/07/max-num-of-open-windows-under-xp-2003-vista-resolved.aspx)' explaining the issue and a possible fix.

> Longtime Windows users are familiar with the desktop heap, a memory space that Windows allocates for desktop objects such as, well, windows.
> 
> Each open window or other desktop object uses up a certain amount of the desktop heap. In older versions of Windows the desktop heap was very small, and objects weren't always disposed from the heap correctly.
> 
> This was a good part of the reason for the Incredible Shrinking Resource Heap problem that plagued the 16 and hybrid 16/32-bit versions of Windows.
> 
> NT fixed this problem by devoting a far larger chunk of memory to the desktop heap -- but the fact that it had a far better memory manager than Win 3.x or Win9x, and a pure 32-bit architecture, didn't hurt either.

> The desktop heap limit affects the NT/VISTA family of systems, Hitting the limit is manifested as either a DLL initialization error for USER32.dll or an out of memory error.

> Fortunately, the limit it tweakable, the default settings are low enough that the limit is easily hit.

> 
> Changing the SharedSection entry to "**<font color="#008080">1024,3072,512</font>**" (note the comma and the value)increases the size of the "hidden" desktop heap.

> If that doesn't work, try increasing the second of the comma delimited values (e.g.<font color="#008080"> **3072 -> 4096**</font>) which is the size limit of any particular desktop heap.

I did the modification and for the moment didn't had any issue, but I will wait one more week to be sure that it works good for me.
