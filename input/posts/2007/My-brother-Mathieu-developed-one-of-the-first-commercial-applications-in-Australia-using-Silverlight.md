As stated in the blog of [Frank Arrigo](http://blogs.msdn.com/frankarr/) (responsible for all Technical Communities in Australia),

> One of the things we will be showing at [ReMIX](http://microsoft.com/australia/remix07) is a preview of Discovery Channel Asia's "Never Miss TV" developed by local digital agency [@www](http://www.atwww.com.au/). It's one of the first commercial applications developed in Australia using [Silverlight.](http://www.silverlight.net/)

The digital agency [@www](http://www.atwww.com.au/) referenced by Frank is the company in which my brother [Mathieu](http://www.techheadbrothers.com/Auteurs.aspx?Id=337eb7bf-2bba-417c-be9d-20488ba6732a) is working. 

A couple of weeks ago he made a demonstration of [Silvelright](http://www.silverlight.net/) in @www and now he has implemented a first commercial application using it that will be demonstrated during [ReMIX 2007](http://www.microsoft.com/australia/remix07/) in Australia and Asia. 

I have seen the last bits of it today, and it rocks!!! 

Congrats brother, you are really **GOOD**.
