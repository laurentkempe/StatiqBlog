Â What I was missing after some use of Vista is the way I was using the shorcuts of Windows Desktop Search in my day to day activities. On Vista I prefer having just to type the windows key to get into the textbox ready to type the query. The bad point on Vista is that it was missing the shortcut part. 

Now it is over with [**Start++**](http://brandontools.com/content/StartPlusPlus.aspx)** **from [Brandon Paddock](http://brandonlive.com/). Great job Brandon, Thanks.
